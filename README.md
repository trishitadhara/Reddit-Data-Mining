The urgency of understanding public sentiments and emotions regarding climate change has never been 
more critical. Online platforms, particularly Reddit, offer a unique space where diverse perspectives 
converge. This study aims to unravel how Reddit users across various subreddits express sentiments and 
emotions concerning climate change. We delve into the emotional and cognitive dimensions prevalent 
within these discussions. As climate change discourse is multifaceted, we draw inspiration from relevant 
papers, such as Fast et al.'s "Empath: Understanding topic signals in large-scale text" (2016) and Oreskes' 
"Beyond the ivory tower: The scientific consensus on climate change" (2004).
