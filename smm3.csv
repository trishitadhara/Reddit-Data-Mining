Some quotes from [Politifact on this claim](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/24/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-iraq-war-dollars-could-have-ended-wo/):\n\n> But a host of experts we talked to agreed that the $30 billion a year figure is impossible to verify and likely incorrect. (The UN Food and Agriculture Organization did not respond to our request for more information about where their estimate comes from.)\n\n> ...\n\n> ""I don\'t believe in the UN claim,"" said William Easterly, a development economist and co-director of New York University’s Development Research Institute. ""The numbers on the extent of world hunger are notoriously unreliable. There is only fragmentary data on stunting and wasting in children, the only direct measure of hunger.""\n\n> ...\n\n> Liz Young researches world hunger at Staffordshire University in England and is the author of the book Food and Development. Young said the claim is ""impossible to substantiate.""\n\n\nFAO now puts the number at [$265 billion per year](http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4951e.pdf):\n\n> We can end poverty and hunger by 2030. But we will need a new approach that results in much higher level of\nresources mobilized towards hunger eradication than in a “business-as-usual” scenario. Such an approach combines\npublic investment in social protection with public and private investment in productive sectors – especially in rural\nareas and, particularly, in agriculture.\n\n> More specifically, additional resources amounting to an annual average of US$265 billion per year during 2016–30,\ni.e. 0.3 percent of the average projected world income for that period, are required to fund both additional\ninvestment in social protection and additional targeted pro-poor investments in productive activities, of which rural\nareas would receive US$181 billion annually. This amount is well within the capacity of the international community\nto mobilize.\n\nFrom what I\'m reading, the approach to ending world hunger varies wildly from source to source, which is why the figure is as little as [$7 billion](http://news.trust.org/item/20180313162224-jqsvk) all the way up to the $265 billion figure earlier.\n\nAll this is to say that it\'s irresponsible to keep repeating ""Jeff Bezos has enough wealth that he could end world hunger, but he chooses not to,"" and to keep using the _likely incorrect_ number of $30 billion.

We are (or were) talking specifically about Gates though, and I feel like he is far less shitty than someone like Bezos. \n\n>Do you really think they are benevolent? \n\nAgain, no. As a general rule I don't think billionaires should even exist, they should be taxed to fucking hell once they start having that much wealth. No one could possibly even use that much money, and we shouldn't live in a society that allows that level of greed to be rewarded. However, now that Gates specifically has that money, I think he's doing a pretty good job trying to get rid of it.

I really underestimated myself. ""I\'m just one person"" type of thinking. It\'s incredible when a system you design finally sinks it\'s teeth in and takes off. It\'s awe inspiring watching the trophic cascades happen... first bees, then birds, then rabbits and squirrels and frogs, then the things that eat them all, the hawks, the foxes, snakes, even wolves move in. I don\'t even know where they all come from. I just know they weren\'t here before.

My first plantings were all ""dense"" as I dared, but I still put trees at 20 foot centers, and 3 bushes between them. Now when I plant I put trees at 5 foot centers and 5 bushes between them, and stuff all in any open space I can cram them in. What happens is the strongest trees will dominate the space, but the others will still chill there. Then if one of the big boys gets damaged, and light opens up, the system responds just like nature does... the others take off and fill the space. \n\nI wish I knew the power of saving my own genetics earlier. The first few seasons I didn\'t collect seed from quick growing annuals and spread them. However, now I have my own genetics of tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, etc. These are all at least 3 generations in. Some of the plants I can get multiple generations in one season (peas, beans, etc) are on their 10th or 15th generation. I save the biggest, strongest, tastiest seeds. The plants from those seeds are so much better than they started, because the best plants that grew in MY soil, MY weather, MY insect load, etc... they were saved. Saving your own seeds and making your own genetics is really powerful.\n\nOne last thing is that I wish I knew how powerful setting an area up first is. I now sheet mulch my expansion a full year in advance. I let the soil build up underneath the protection of woodchips. I plant in some early nitrogen fixers, very densely, to build up the liquid carbon and the life in the soil. Then after a full year, only THEN do I plant my trees in. By this point the fungal component of the soil is built up, and the trees grow in an environment they want to be in. I avoid a lot of plant loss this way - by strategically planting leafy bacterial soil builders, and slowly transitioning into woody bushes and trees later.

When in doubt, visit wild areas around you, see what\'s growing there, get identifying plants, learn about them on www.pfaf.org.

That doesn\'t effect the callory count or caloric intake, as you could just make more farms.\n\nhttps://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/prediction-extinction-rebellion-climate-change-will-kill-6-billion-people-unsupported-roger-hallam-bbc/\n\n>It is likely that climate change will exacerbate food insecurity in many parts of the world, especially in the developing tropics, but even under the worst-case scenarios (e.g.10-20% yield declines of staple crops, combined with gross income inequality, political instability, and continued high population growth rates), it is hard to conceive how the death toll would exceed tens of millions or, at most, the low hundreds of millions. Of course, a potential death toll of tens of millions is gravely alarming and should be treated with great moral urgency. But I do not believe it is helpful to grossly exaggerate the predictions that have been made.\n\nHmm and this is under *RCP8.5 which isn\'t considered viable*. It\'s almost like going extinct isn\'t why were doing this! Obviously its a nonzero number but seriously that\'s just an absurd assumption.\n\n>And on the other hand you\'ll have people that can\'t live where they used to because lack of food/clean water or coastal cities that are flooded. These people will want to move and live somewhere else where the resources isn\'t plentiful. \n\nThis is a problem that has always happened. Sure it will be exacerbated by climate change but it\'s absolutely silly to assume it\'s a new problem at all. A very handwavey comment tbh, ""ooh people will be displaced!!!"". You know how many people are displaced even *today?* Sure Climate change will only add to the problem but it\'s like you assume we haven\'t gone through it before... And jsyk, the population in most of the countries they would move to is *falling.* People in 1st world countries have better education, therefore less children. It\'s obviously still a problem but let\'s not act like population is a large issue.\n\n>This is only based on the 2 degree increase\n\nWhich you misunderstand and overhype.\n\n>and to succeed with it CO2 emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 globally. \n\nThis is for 1.5C, not 2C, and on top of that the 2030 deadline is for around half, to make sure we become neutral by 2050. It\'s more important that we\'re neutral by 2050 than half by 2035. And on our current trajectory we\'re looking at around 2-4C, although it\'s looking like it might be lower.\n\nBut it seems like you still have a misunderstanding - this isn\'t even about human survival - extinction isn\'t really in the cards. It\'s about civilization and having a constantly improving society. The idea of things getting better and better globally is what is being challenged, not human extinction. So commenting ""haha if we want a chance let\'s stay under 2C!!"" Is really just scaring people while not being backed up whatsoever. \n\nTl;dr Climate change is a threat, our biggest one but commenting what you did  makes no sense because were not fucked unless we get above a big number.', 'Thanks, have now edited.', ""There's some lot of opposition and also permitting issues.

The logic goes that the right and neoliberal wings in Western democracies - that have dominated our politics for decades - have had to find a fresh way to pursue the politics of wealth inequality. That is to say, austerity was a political choice: it was an unnecessary and economically vandalistic ideological policy pursued by governments in order to dismantle welfare states, national projects, and governmental assistance. But since this is now well known and austerity is unfashionable, they\'ve needed a new way to pursue this ideology. The Green New Deal offers that way: by coadopting it, they can sell austerity measures as Green measures. That\'s why they\'re going for the Green vote and it\'s why so much intellectual energy is being spent on convincing us that climate action is an *individual* rather than a *systemic* problem (with Capitalism). E.g. you can solve climate change by recycling more, buying a hybrid, cycling to work, etc, and not by voting for a more controlled and restricted economy, i.e. a left wing option.\n\n#The Tories on Climate Action?\n\nThe record on climate action of this government generally and Boris specifically is terrible. Boris himself has previously described fracking as ""glorious news for humanity"" and promised to ""leave no stone unturned, or unfracked"" in pursuit of shale gas. [Let me link the article he wrote in 2012 where he says that: from the horse\'s mouth.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9733518/Ignore-the-doom-merchants-Britain-should-get-fracking.html) He also [hired a former fracking lobbyist](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/30/fracking-lobbyist-hired-to-draw-up-tory-manifesto-rachel-wolf) to help write the Conservatives election manifesto for *this* 2019 election. Boris himself is funded by climate sceptics: he received donations of £5,000 from Michael Hintze and £25,000 from Terence Mordaunt (via First Corporate Shipping) who fund the climate science sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation. In 2018 he travelled to the US funded by the American Enterprise Institute - a thinktank funded by oil firms and climate science sceptics which is [to this day propagandising on his behalf](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/is-boris-johnson-headed-to-big-brexit-victory/) - to [receive their highest award.](https://www.aei.org/society-and-culture/from-the-archives-special-relationships/?fbclid=IwAR1hKORNI844DWka_vREssihvbcqXWFqE8st-InJhARKos0gWDKaSgR_PJc)\n\nWhat about the record of the Tories in general? Well, remember that Tory MPs (including Johnson) are [**five times as likely**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/tory-mps-five-times-more-likely-to-vote-against-climate-action) to vote against climate action than the general MP. The Tories are, of course, quite happy to make large displays of Climate Action, such as their support for the cross-party Climate Change Act in 2008. Of course, they promptly contradicted this by voting to [expand Heathrow airport in 2009](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jan/15/bbaaviation-theairlineindustry), voting against new rules mandating improvements in energy efficiency rules for landlords in 2011, voting against the [decarbonisation target](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/mps-back-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill) and again against [low carbon subsidies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jun/04/mps-back-decarbonisation-target-energy-bill) in June 2013. After the Scots banned fracking in 2015 the [Tories voted down the Westminster attempt to ban it across the UK](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/28/scotland-announces-moratorium-on-fracking-for-shale-gas) and then proceeded to vote against making permits required for fracking, then [against a climate levy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/green-energy-sector-attacks-budget-climate-change-levy) and [against a vehicle emissions tax \\(that was a manifesto promise\\)](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-osborne-unveils-green-car-tax-overhaul-to-fund-roadbuilding) later in 2015. Finally, on 14th March 2016 they [scored a trifecta](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/environmental-and-economic-impact-of-british-energy-policy): voting against even coming up with a plan for a national strategy for carbon capturing, against a decarbonisation target, and against onshore wind subsidies. Then in 2018 they [voted again to expand Heathrow.](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/heathrow-airport-expansion)\n\nIt is absolutely and unambiguously clear that this is a cynical election strategy by the Conservative party and their record in government over this critical period proves beyond a doubt that it is an empty promise.\n\nI hope that\'s helpful.', 'Wow, Incredibly.

It seems it is mostly about population growth, or avoidance thereof:\n\n> Population growth is a direct function of fertility, mortality, and migration. Therefore, educational attainment, which influences the dynamics of all three, is extremely relevant for projections of future population growth. In many ways, **the educational composition of a society can either challenge or facilitate reductions in greenhouse gases**, thereby contributing to reversing global warming. Understanding the interaction between education and determinants of population size is key to analyzing the relationship between population growth and emissions trajectories.\n\n> **Among educational factors influencing population growth, female education and education-specific fertility are predominant.** In most contexts, the amount of education achieved influences the timing of marriage, timing of births, desired family size, and total number of births. Women with more schooling tend to marry later, delay childbearing longer, and have fewer children than their peers who have less education. The impact of education on females’ fertility is context-specific and varies by a country’s stage of development—with the educational composition of women in countries that have yet to complete the demographic transition having a particularly strong effect on fertility and future population.\n\n> In addition to or in concert with family planning, **female education is one of the proven, cost-effective long-term solutions for addressing unsustainable rates of population growth in high-fertility countries.**\n\n[Source: Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/women-and-girls/educating-girls)', 'Yeah, you’re definitely right and I really appreciate your attitude; it’s how we should all be thinking.

When they first introduced their bill the predominant US feedstock was coal and natural gas was a relatively small player, so at that time the bill made a lot of mathematical sense because feedstocks like waste-to-energy (despite their well documented and significant ecological downsides) had significantly lower co2-to-energy ratios than coal and therefore exempting them would not be counterproductive from a purely climate mitigation perspective (eg ignoring their ecological ramifications).\n\nCCL could not have foreseen the virtually overnight rise of natural gas, a feedstock that has a co2-to-energy footprint that is less than half that of coal and significantly less than feedstocks like waste-to-energy.\n\nBut things change and math is math. What was once an acceptable exemption/oversight (and only if ecology is not factored in) when coal was the predominant feedstock is no longer acceptable now that natural gas is the predominant feedstock.', '[The bill is still really effective](https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/assessment-energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act).', 'I’ll review the data sets upon which they base their findings, but I can tell you right off the bat that their assertion that energy sector emissions will drop by 82-84 percent by 2030 is misguided at best.\n\nThe EPA as well as independent, peer-reviewed research provides data on the emissions of virtually all feedstocks. And as I’ve iterated and reiterated time and time again, natural gas burns cleaner than virtually every other feedstocks except for solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear.\n\nNone of those cleaner burning feedstocks, even if aggregated, can ramp up output to meet US energy demands by 2030. I mean not even close.\n\nBut guess which feedstocks can eat up a fair chunk of that market share? That’s right, the very ones I’ve been alluding to (ex: waste-to-energy) which happen to emit more co2 per kilowatt hour than natural gas.\n\nI know it’s hard to keep incredulity at bay when discussing complex data-driven issues such as this one, but please try to understand that a) natural gas burns as clean or cleaner than virtually all other feedstocks beyond the five I listed above b) the current CCL bill will allow those relatively dirtier feedstocks to gain market share at natural gas’ expense.\n\nIt’s sad but true, mathematically speaking.\n\nNatural gas is not sustainable longterm, but it would be unwise to exempt feedstocks that are even less sustainable both climatologically and ecologically, especially since said dirtier feedstocks are represented by deep pocketed corporate entities and already enjoy generous subsidies and incentives at both the state and federal level.\n\nI know it seems unintuitive but the data doesn’t lie. It tells a very subtle, but important story.', '> None of those cleaner burning feedstocks, even if aggregated, can ramp up output to meet US energy demands by 2030.\n\nBased on what?', 'As much as I would like to put together a full syllabus for you on both current US energy production by source as well projected energy production by source, I don’t have the time.\n\nWhat I would recommend that you do is start by googling things like “solar energy production”, “solar energy projections”, “wind energy production”, “wind energy projections”, etc. and so forth. That way, you can become more familiar with the United States’ truly gargantuan appetite for electricity (eg 4 billion+ kilowatt hours per year) and how much each feedstock currently generates and is capable of generating in the immediate future.\n\nWhen you’re done with that I’d recommend that you familiarize yourself with a department within the US Department of Energy called the Bioenergy Technology Office (or BETO for short):\nhttps://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy\n\nThis federal entity is quite literally pumping hundreds of millions of dollars per year into feedstocks that are currently as dirty or dirtier than natural gas. They have scores of laboratories setup throughout the country and team up with scores of the top universities in the country specifically to work on biofuel and waste to energy feedstock optimization. In other words, their primary focus is not funding and/or researching the scaling solar or wind (The two feedstocks that are truly scalable in the longterm while also being truly climate friendly from an emissions perspective). They’re working on scaling things like biogas from industrial cattle farms and waste-to-energy combustion facilities that incinerate the mountains of garbage we create.\n\nThese feedstocks that BETO supports are operated by some of the largest corporate entities in the world and they are derived via some of the most environmentally unfriendly practices known to man, yet receive “renewable” designations at both the federal and state level. Garbage and cow manure are only renewable in the most cynical sense, and yet that is the official designation they receive, which in turn, leads to massive government subsidies, tax relief, etc. at the federal and state level.\n\nAnd as I’ve mentioned various times, according to EPA facility-level data, most if not all of these bio or waste derived feedstocks currently burn dirtier than natural gas.\n\nExempting them from a carbon tax will ensure that these feedstocks, which are heavily subsidized and supported by federal and state governments and heavily backed by established corporate interests will gain an even more substantial share of the US market even though a) they present various extremely undesirable ecological ramifications b) they emit more co2 per kilowatt hour of energy produced than natural gas c) upstream ghg emissions and ecological damage manifested by the industries from which these feedstocks are derived are both massive and dire.\n\nNow I have a question you? \n\nWhy is it that you and every senior member of CCL that I’ve engaged with refused to even consider the thought of amending the existing bill so that it doesn’t exempt feedstocks like waste to energy?\n\nIs it because, as you mentioned, there isn’t the requisite political will to do so at this time?\n\nIf so, that speaks volumes about the political backing that these ecologically and climatologically dirty feedstocks posses. And based on the degree of funding and political backing they currently receive coupled with both the ecological toll they inflict and the climatologically relevant emissions they produce there is no way that I can support a bill that exempts them.\n\nDo enough reading up on the matter and you may eventually come to the same conclusion.', ""CCL didn't write the bill.\n\nYou are ascribing more power to CCL staff than is justified given reality."", 'Understood.

A total of almost 4 million hectares (10 million acres) of timber is harvested each year, but most of that timber regenerates and remains classified as forested land, albeit at a different successional stage. So the deforestation here refers to lands that are converted from forest to some other purpose. Deforestation could increase in the future because tree pests and diseases such as bark beetles are becoming more prevalent in the face of climate change.\n\n\n\nReforestation Rates\n\nIn the United States, deforestation has been more than offset by reforestation between 1990 and 2010. The nation added 7,687,000 hectares (18,995,000 acres) of forested land during that period. The trend in reforesting areas has been driven by organizations such as the U.S. Forest Service and the Arbor Day Foundation. Reforestation efforts were critical to maintain forest cover starting at the beginning of the 20th century, and they are the reason that there is a net positive trend in forest growth today.\n\n\nhttps://education.seattlepi.com/rates-deforestation-reforestation-us-3804.html', 'While I agree with most of your post, this subreddit it meant for these kinds of ""feel good"" posts in order to show  people that they are not alone in the fight against climate change and that positive changes can be made.

If we are to achieve this we need to be angry and desperate rather than optimistic. Postd and articles like these can point out positive news but I believe that they should *always* emphasize the fact that we are losing the fight against climate change and we are losing badly.\n\nSo I suppose that there isn't much practical utility in this entire sub, save for posts about climate protests which encourage solidarity and serve as calls to arms. If we sit here and allow ourselves to get comforted by the fact that a handful of governments are planting a ton of trees, we are doomed. If we wait for states to save us via gradual, capitalist reform and modest actions like these, we are doomed. If we start believing that tree planting will be effective against climaglte change, well, likewise.\n\nAgain, the only thing that will save us, in my opinion is mass, global working class movements, whatever means necessary, to assert ourselves against capitalist pillaging.

Something on this scale is entirely impossible. I get that these articles never claim that planting trees alone is what we need to do and that they aren\'t directly mitigating other actions besides planting trees, but they reinforce outmoded ideas that we can save ourselves by just planting a shit ton of trees while not actually fundamentally altering our modes of production and rapacious capitalist incentives. Again, every article and post of this nature, to have any utility and to not be counterproductive, must clearly remind us of the harsher realities.

It gives false hope, not a call to action.\n\nOf course you can have both optimism and direct action; I'm not saying that these are mutually exclusive. Quite the contrary, you need to have hope in order to have motivation in order to assert yourself politically.

Planting a few million trees is the barest of the bare minimum of state actions to actually solve maybe the greatest threat to humanity ever, so why should we applaud them? Why should we pat Canada on the back, for instance, when they plant 100 million trees, when they are cutting down even more trees to build a pipeline because our politics are lobbied to the core by fossil fuel giants and ignorant Albertan country-folk conservatives who would rather watch the world burn than change industries? Why should we pretend that Scotland or any other state is taking meaningful climate action when this isn't at all the case in any real practical sense?

I think that we should, instead, demonstrate, agitate, revolt, or engage in whatever means necessary to actually stop climate change from the 2.0°C (or 1.5°) temperature increase. It isn\'t too late to half climate change and to ensure the habitability of the planet (for the vast majority - the impoverished and landless are already fucked *today*). I don\'t think there\'s much utility in focusing primarily on small lifestyle changes of personal responsibility, such as using less air conditioning, at the expense of focusing on corporate rapacity and capitalist environmental pillaging.\n\n100 companies are responsible for the vast majority of climate change. If we want to combat it we need to combat the root of why this is a fact and we shouldn\'t be forced to feel personally responsible for the crisis due to our individual carbon footprints. Yes, we should absolutely all try to eat less meat, not be needlessly wasteful, etc. But the focus on the individual responsibility is just a way that capitalists have shifted responsibility from themselves and the system itself onto the individual consumers.

These articles distract us from wtf is really going on. Taken together, they paint a picture of progress, that countries are finally coming together to meaningfully prevent climate change. This depiction is simply wrong and I don't think we need to debate this because all you have to do is look around. We still have 100 companies responsible for the vast majority of climate change and we do absolutely fuck all to rein them in besides obsequiously rewarding them with less regulation and taxes.\n\nOur collective mindset is not progressing, at least in terms of governance.

I have some tips for you.\n\nTrees hate being planted how this tree is planted, but there are some fast adjustments you can make. Mow the lawn around it, then toss down a sheet of cardboard, then 6 inches of woodchips down. Do this in a 4 foot diameter circle. Leave 3 inches around the tree trunk completely bare soil (i.e. don\'t put the woodchip mulch right up against the trunk, you will cause rot issues and potential boring insect damage).\n\nIf you are interested in more info on why (I find knowing WHY is a good way to anchor new knowledge and increase retention)....\n\nAll natural ecosystems follow a general transition from dead soil to weed pit to grass land, to brush land to forest. In this transition, the soil microbiolgy slowly turns from bacterial dominated to fungal dominated. Nature wouldn\'t stick a tree in the middle of grass like this. It\'s like throwing a fish on the lawn and wondering why it died.\n\nWhen nature throws the first woody bushes in a grassland, they struggle and die. They fall on the ground. Mushrooms tear the dead wood apart and feed and grow. This fungal network now allows more bushes to survive longer and stronger. The mushroom mycelium (underground fine-hairlike network) wraps itself around the tree roots and ties everything together. It balances nutrient, water, ph, everything. It acts as root-extenders for the trees. Trees on the planet earth have developped this symbiotic relationship with fungus for (almost) as long as trees have been around for. (In truth, fungus evolved the ability to consume lignins in wood, and at one point, nothing would decompose trees - they would just sit there, not rotting).\n\nOkay so this tree here, it wants a fungal domianted soil, but you have planted it in a bacterial dominated soil, surrounded by heavy feeding grasses that will out-compete the tree. It will struggle massively and likely not make it beyond a year.\n\nThe solution is to quickly transition the soil microbiology towards fungal dominated soils. We do that in 2 ways.\n\n1. We need to get rid of the grass. We can pull it out, but even better is to use it as sacrificial food for plant microbiology. So instead we will SMOTHER it. This is where the card board comes in. The cardboard will prevent the grass from seeing light, and it will die. As it does, it\'s roots will weaken and become food for soil life. Over time, the cardboard will itself decompose and after about 6 months it will also be worm food.\n2. We also put woodchips down, as the only thing that can break this down is fungus. There will be dormant saprophytic fungi in all woodchips, so you won\'t need to worry about ""planting"" mushrooms in it - unless you specifically want something like King Stropharia/Winecap to eat yourself as a crop. I highly recommend it, they are delicious. Either way, the woodchips will become food for fungi, and the tree will be happy being planted in a fungal dominated soil. Ideally this is done a year in advance, so that the tree doesn\'t spend it\'s most vulnerable year of it\'s life in the most un-evolved soil condition, but it is what it is. Better to get this going though, asap.\n\nMy food forest expansions, I always sheet mulch them (cardboard, compost, woodchips) a full year in advance of any tree planting. Anyone else reading this, right now (the fall for us northern hemisphere folks) is the PERFECT time to start sheet mulching a bed for next spring planting (if you are in a colder region) or next fall planting (if you are in a hot region).\n\nAny questions, please ask.

Most of that CO2 will be sequestered in the first 30-40 years of growth. Depending on lifestyle, a regular person will use between 3 and 10 ton CO2 a year. You can do the math after that.\n\nIf you want to be a bit more [precise](http://urbanforestrynetwork.org/benefits/air%20quality.htm):\n> Young trees absorb CO2 at a rate of 13 pounds per tree each year. Trees reach their most productive stage of carbon storage at about 10 years at which point they are estimated to absorb 48 pounds of CO2 per year. At that rate, they release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support two human being\n\nSo, while over the course of a tree's life you could do with planting say, 10 trees a year through a tree planting NGO, it takes a long time before the trees have taken up enough CO2 to actually compensate. So by that logic, for the first 20-30 years you'd be running a deficit. \n\nLet's look at it over a 10 year period. Say you use 6 tons of CO2, which is what an average westerner who lives consciously easily comes out to. That involves some car driving, perhaps one or two short flights a year, heating the home through gas, that kind of stuff. Over a 10 year period you will have accumulated 60 tons (or 132277 pounds) of CO2. One tree in 10 years, according to the link I quoted will absorb 309 pounds of CO2 in 10 years, assuming a linear growth from 13 pounds to 48 pounds of CO2 a year.\n\nThis means, in order to offset your emissions in the next 10 years, you would have to plant 428 trees today. After 10 years of course, you become VERY carbon negative as the tipping point has been reached. \n\nEasier is to simply donate monthly, so that about 5 trees may be planted every month on average. Over the course of 12 years you will then have removed 128160 pounds from the atmosphere, meaning at that point you are more less carbon neutral over that period. Afterwards, you will become heavily carbon negative as your forest continues to grow and remove more and more CO2. Of course, if you consider that you may have been alive between 20-50 years already, you will have a carbon debt of 120 to 300 tons already, which will take another ~10 years to remove. This is all a bit rudimentary of course. I mean, children in their first few years probably don't use as much CO2 as an adult, and not every tree that gets planted survives and keeps sucking up CO2. \n\nPoint is, if you start today and donate enough for an equivalent of 5 trees to be planted every month, you can be sure that in 12 years you will be carbon neutral over that period, in 20 years you are approaching being carbon neutral for your entire existence and afterwards you will be heavily carbon negative.\n\nTake heed that you find a GOOD tree planting organization. Not one that just shoots a bunch of seeds in the ground and hopes of the best, find one that has tree nurseries that plant young trees or saplings. They cost more money per tree, but those trees will have a much higher chance of taking and developing into a functioning ecosystem. This will cost a few euro's or dollars per tree at least. \n\nQuite frankly, the cost of living CO2 neutral by planting trees over the course of 10-20 years will be between 20-30 euros or dollars a month, if you want to be realistic about it."", ""This is our 3rd tulip tree we planted.

Trees sequester the majority of their carbon in the juvenile phase - when growth is rampant - kind of like human teenagers. It gets more complicated now though...\n\nSome will say that a tree sequesters a ton of carbon in 40 years. Others say that a tree does not sequester much carbon because all carbon that is stored will eventually decompose, releasing all that carbon back. Both sides are simply wrong. The first because they ignore the decomposition of the tree. The second because they ignore all the snowballing side-effects that trees do to ecosystems. In short, it\'s almost impossible to determine how much carbon a tree sequesters, because it\'s really really freaking complicated.\n\nBut what really matters is... how do we sequester the MOST carbon?\n\n**1) Lets talk about when it\'s alive...**\n\nWhen the tree is alive, it is not only taking carbon out of the air to put it into it\'s body (literally growing out of thin air), it is actually also secreting these carbon chains called plant-root-edudates into the soil. Often this is called ""liquid carbon"". Think of these edudates like little bacteria and fungal treats. The soil microbiology eats these treats and ""sequester"" the carbon and nutrients into their body.\n\nNow these microorganisms pee and poo and die. These 3 processes bind, or ""chelate"" the nutrients onto organic acids like humic acid and fulvic acid. Only once bound to these long acid chains does the nutrient become ""bioavailable to plants"". So, for example, it\'s not enough to dump nitrogen on the ground to feed plants - you need nitrifying bacteria in the soil, to convert that nitrogen into bioavailable forms that the plant can take up. This is what ""industrial agriculture"" has really lost. You can\'t till a field and kill all the soil life, then dump nitrogen on it, and expect much of it to get to the plants. Most of it washes away, and the longer you perform detrimental acts like tilling, the worse it gets over time. Then we get stuff like deadzones in the gulf of Mexico happening, because soil isn\'t soil anymore, it\'s dirt. But I digress (I have the tendancy to fly off topic for stuff I\'m passionate about).\n\nOkay, so while the tree is alive, it\'s pumping carbon into it\'s body, but ALSO carbon into the soil. This second aspect is often not calculated.\n\n**2) Lets talk about once the tree dies...**\n\nWhen the tree dies in a forest, it will fall on the ground and be fungus food. Mushrooms will eat the wood, and in the process they release CO2 into the air. Because of this, most (but not all) of the carbon stored in the tree\'s body will get re-volatized into the air as CO2. If there is no oxygen present, then methane is made - CH4. Methane is 100x worse of a GHG (greenhouse gas) for the first 20 years of it\'s lifetime in the air, and after 100 years in the air, CH4 is 30x worse of a GHG. So all our efforts should be towards preventing CH4 releases.\n\nHowever, we can do better than letting all planted trees decompose...\n\nWe can trap and bind that carbon before mushrooms tear it all apart. How?\n\n2a) We can make furniture out of it. Houses out of it. Eventually most of this will be thrown away, and will eventually decompose, but that\'s a battle you can\'t really stop. Houses and furniture will likely lock the carbon up for a good 100-300 years - which DOES help, despite what people may say about it being ""neutral eventually"".\n\n2b) We can make BIOCHAR out of it. Forgive the quality, [but this was my first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vkUevM7LzM), and I show how to make biochar in a way that re-combusts the gases as much as possible, to minimize CO2 release.\n\n**Okay, so why make biochar**\n\nCharcoal is basically anything made of carbon that has all the gases pushed out of it, and all that remains is a bunch of carbon chains. We want to do this because carbon in this form is EXTREMELY stable. Biochar ammended into soils will last 1000-2000 years, locked up and trapped.\n\nMore than that, it will be bonding sites for nutrient and water (and toxins) and will act as nutrient and water batteries for plants. In this way, it actually helps tremendously for tree survival and vigor - providing drought resistance, etc.\n\nAlso, because of the [microscopic form of biochar](https://images.app.goo.gl/ABizTV8QfRBbUMWx7), it provides soil microbiology habitat to colonize. It is this reason that I actually make my biochar and then put it in the compost for a few months - to get charged up with both nutrient and life. Only THEN do I add it to my food forest and future tree plantings.\n\nWhere to get the fuel for the biochar?\n\n**I.e. HOW TO SEQUESTER THE MOST CARBON POSSIBLE**\n\nRemember how trees grow fastest in the 0 to 40 year range, and sequester the majority of their carbon in that span? Well, it just so happens that several extremely vigorous trees can be kept in this juvenile stage INDEFINITELY using [a system called coppicing](https://images.app.goo.gl/xKnH5eTHnzX7p8S77).\n\nCoppicing a tree is to cut it ankle height when it is roughly 5 to 10 years old. This seems drastic, but what happens is extreme vigour and regrowth from the stump. 10-20 shoots will fire up, and the most dominant 3-5 of these are chosen - the rest are pruned. The tree will now be allowed to re-grow off these shoots for another 5-10 years, remaining in the juvenile stage. After 5-10 years, these are then re-harvested.\n\nThis system has been used to provide ancient people\'s with ""infinite"" firewood, but we can use it to provide us with infinite ""fuel"" for our biochars. I.e. infinite carbon sequestration, only bounded by the vigor of the growth of the tree. [Here I show my sumac coppice system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx0RqFGvXh0). Again, sorry for the video quality, I\'m not a youtuber, I\'m an engineer! I\'m getting better though. [Here is the same area, and you can see the regrowth 3 months later. Intense regrowth.](https://youtu.be/c1Y6m_NjBUo?t=20m23s)\n\nSo lets stop and understand what we are doing now... we are removing the phase of a tree\'s life where it re-releases the CO2 (as it decomposes) and we are keeping the tree locked into a phase of permanent vigorous growth. Birch trees live roughly 30 years, but there are 500-year old birch trees cppices, because the tree never ages while kept in the coppice. [Here is another 500 year old coppice.](http://www.ruislipwoodstrust.org.uk/coppicing.html) So in this way we turn a carbon neutral tree growth/death, and turn the tree into a carbon pump.\n\n**Getting back to your point - how much carbon? - TO SUMMARIZE**\n\nA tree planted and left alone will sequester roughly 1 ton of carbon for the next 40 years, then release slightly less than that over the next 10 or so, as it decays. Not a great method - we only ""sequester"" a few percent of the carbon when we extend the duration of our observation out to the death of the tree and beyond as it re-releases it\'s carbon. However, a bit better...\n\nA tree planted in a food forest guild, where the entire forest system replicates itself, will constantly keep pushing this carbon sequestering down the road, because new trees will continuously be planted by fallen seed. However, again, most of the carbon will get re-released. It\'s more about getting carbon into tree\'s bodies for the next 50 years when we need it the most. However, even better...\n\nLightning driven forest fires will release a bunch of carbon quickly, but will also sequester megatons of carbon from the charcoal that it creates. It acts as using this giant stored reserve of tree-body carbon to release half (say) and store half for a millenia. Ihis is good LONG TERM, but very bad short term, as the carbon is released today, and the stored carbon is stored for millenia. However, MUCH better....\n\n... we can do this process ourselves, AND REBURN the combustion/pyrolysis gases, and release almost no carbon short term, but store the majority of it for millenia. When we do this to coppice systems, we can sequester tremendous amounts of carbon. And the best part is, YOU can do it. All of us can.\n\nI work 40 hours a week, have 3 kids in rep hockey, and a wife to keep happy, and I run a relatively small coppice biochar system and sequester roughly 400 trees worth of carbon per year. That is roughly 10 tons of carbon every single year, and it takes me about 10 hours each day, for about 4 total days in the whole year. And it\'s basically just a giant fun ""bonfire"" - a nice way to spend a cold winter saturday.\n\nTL:DR - there is no TLDR for saving the planet. Please read, and learn and then spread the word. We can do amazing things using plants to act as carbon pumps, and rebuild our soils while we are at it. AND grow food and SAVE YOU MONEY. It\'s seriously win win win win win.

They are doing so much work to remove so much value. They are priceless. \n\nIf you have rotting stumps then you will have tons of fungal activity. The main goal will be killing grass to avoid competition and bacterial soil. I would still mulch around the tree though - especially if you can get free woodchips. They are just so valuable - they represent like 50 years of stored solar energy (the energy is stored in the carbon bonds in the wood). If you have rotting logs that you can pick up and put around the tree, that can work too.

You can buy them at pet shops, though I didn't eat any of the first generation because of fears over food allergy contamination. I raised them in a glass aquarium with oats for bedding. Open water will kill them, so they need fresh carrots, raw potatoes, sweet potatoes, etc. to remain healthy and hydrated. Juicy fruits like strawberries and grapes are too wet for them and will make the bedding rot if you leave it in there for more than about a day. Mealworms are probably the easiest insect to raise ever, the most time consuming part is remembering to take out the old food, and poop that settles to the bottom. You can grow a lot in a small area, but the similarities to factory farming and the wastefulness of the system started making me really depressed. Killing them “humanely” involves putting them in a freezer, which is supposed to be painless, but guilt still nagged at me. If you want to wash them off before cooking, do it after the freezing process, because they’ll freak out and start biting you if you wash them while they are alive (I was told they *never* bite, so that was a bit of a shock to me). I’d fry them with a meal, or roast them and sometimes I’d grind them up into meal. They generally have a deep nutty/toasted flavor, and can be soft or crunchy depending on how you cook them.\n\n* Wax Worms - which **I very strongly advise against** because not only are they incredible escape artists even in their maggoty form, but they [destroy beehives](https://backyardbeekeeping.iamcountryside.com/health-pests/wax-moth-treatment/).

You can but cricket meal online and whole crickets in various forms and flavors. People really liked my cricket cookies and other foods I played around with. They are very crunchy if you eat them whole, and the sharp pieces can be painful sometimes. Slightly odd flavor, I tried them in traditional Mexican cuisine (I forget the name) and wasn't a fan, but some of the snack flavors the come in are pretty decent.\n\n**Warning!** *If you are allergic to sea food like prawns, DON’T eat these! I read they are related or something* :/\n\n• Con nhộng – I believe they are silk worm pupae, you can buy them at Asian markets if you don’t live in Asia, or you can buy them online. The recipe I was taught involved fish sauce (I forget what else), but they have a *very* strong flavor that needs to be covered by other strong flavors. You fry them up and eat them whole in stir fries.

The nutrients in the soil stay in their local ecosystems and get recycled instead of shipped across the world. \n\nFertilizer can be worked out of the ocean and if we were willing to go there, human waste could be recycled and turned into fertilizer. That's not a technological issue really, but a social one and definitely a regulative one (it would have to be highly regulated and highly treated, but it is definitely possible and space stations and space ships would use this for long term stay/travel in space). For more acceptable fertilizer, fish can work splendidly. Aquaponics uses surprisingly little extra fertilizer (especially treated fertilizer) and fish can be fed on either processed fish food (which is still pretty resource intensive unfortunately, but still less required than fish farmed on their own) or natural products, like the scraps grown in the hydroponics system. Bacteria can also turn a ton of stuff into fertilizer that plants can pick up. \n\nThe problem is that these systems tend to be pretty delicate, as they are basically emulating a ecosystem. So while you can fertilize maize or other plants and put tons of pesticide on it and kind of leave it be to grow, cause the medium (soil) is hard to change quickly (pH, nutrient levels, temperatures, etc), hydroponics and aquaponics is a pretty delicate system that can change rapidly. Too much fertilizer is easy for the plant to absorb and destroy it. Too much water stays in the system and dilutes everything. Too high pH has nearly instant effects. Same with low. \n\nThe pro and cons of it is the speed at which the plants grow. But if you have the hang of it, it's fucking awesome. And the benefits far outweigh the cons. \n\nAlthough one of the biggest problems right now is that hydroponics and aquaponics isn't really scalable like regular agriculture. So until robotics and computers become affordable enough, as well as electricity and buildings to house the plants in, I don't think it's gonna become the main way for us to produce food. \n\nBut it would do a huge amount to protect the environment, especially if we could then use the biowaste to create biofuel. \n\n/Rant without any real cohesion"", ""The main problem isn't that it's difficult to grow wheat in hydroponics (it's pretty simple), it's harvesting it on an industrial scale. \n\nYou are kind of correct about potatoes, since they're starchy root vegetables, but it's still somewhat easy to grow them. But you do require quite a bit of depth, at least half a meter and that means for every square meter of potatoes, you need at least half a ton of water and that isn't exactly vertically scalable. That half a ton of water can also sustain around 20 m2 or more of leafy greens in a Nutrient Flow Technique system. \n\nAnd while it is energy intensive to grow vegetables in a hydroponic system, plants only use about 3-6% of the sun's energy. A solar panel can convert 20-30% of it and then we can turn that into light that the plants can use more efficiently (over 30% efficient, but that's 30% of the original 30%, so around 6-9%, which is still as good or 3x better). Then we can also retain heat in these buildings and water, meaning less energy goes into watering and we can grow them all year round, using electricity from other sources as well (such as wind or even biofuel from the parts we don't eat). It's not self sustainable in terms of energy, but it's far better than traditional agriculture, especially in terms of water usage. \n\nAnd with LED's, we can convert virtually all energy into light that's available to plants instead of heat as well. \n\nCurrently, it's not economically viable to grow potatoes or wheat in hydroponics, but I have no doubt that with genetic engineering and some ingenuity, we could make it a viable alternative to things like traditional agriculture, especially in water sparse regions with enough solar (closed environment recirculates water instead of releasing it into the open air). Trees that have fruit are also a challenge, since they tend to need wind and deep roots to do well. So I don't see them being used in hydroponics without some serious genetic engineering to make them like tomato's or cucumbers, that is, more like vines instead of actual trees.\n\nSynthetic meat is good, but also uses a lot of energy to be made. Although it is far more energy efficient than alive animals that need to generate their own body heat (and therefore waste around 90-95% of the energy).

Thing is, most of the acreage used to grow crops is planted to grains.   Much of that grain goes to feeding animals.   In the US a stupid amount also goes towards making ethanol for fuel.   We could get a lot more mileage out of reducing meat consumption, ending ethanol subsidies and reducing population (through reduced birth rates).   In addition, we should be figuring out how to close nutrient loops.  Right now we basically use plants to mine nutrients from soil, eat those plants converting them to excrement, and then contaminating large amounts of with that excrement, which eventually flows out to see causing harmful algal blooms and dead zones.  Ideally we'd be composting the waste, and using that compost to grow woody biomass near cities, providing the dry organic material to use in composting.  Surplus could be used for energy production.   \n\nI think indoor gardening does have a place in cold climates.   We could basically heat houses with the waste heat from lights used to grow food.

98,BREAKING: Oxford University Passes Resolution Banning Investment In Fossil Fuels,,"['""Oxford University has passed a motion requiring its endowment fund to divest from all direct investments in fossil fuel companies, and end future investment in funds that primarily hold stock in fossil fuel companies. The motion further requires endowment managers to request evidence of plans to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from companies across Oxford’s entire portfolio of investments.""\n\nAnother day, another bank/community/establishment divesting from fossil fuels.', 'I personally know a lot of the key people who were involved in making this happen, and I want to clarify a few things:\n\n- **Several Colleges have yet to divest**\n\nThe University of Oxford has a complex financial structure, with individual ""Colleges"" being akin to financially-independent Halls of Residence, as well as the main university. This announcement is that the main university has divested by instructing their investment management division to follow the changes in the motion that was passed.\n\nThis is huge because the central university is extremely rich (~£3bn is being divested), but several of the colleges have not yet divested their own endowments (most of which are tens or hundreds of millions). It\'s an example of how powerful an institution Oxford is that most of its ""poorer"" colleges still have larger endowments than many entire universities. Multiple colleges have divested over several years, but the decentralised system makes this a Kafkaesque slog for student campaigners to get them to divest one by one. Also about half the colleges allow their funds to be controlled by the central University Endowment Fund anyway.\n\n- **This wasn\'t just the recent oil price drop**\n\nCampaigning on this has been going on for years, several colleges divested a few years ago, and this particular motion was organised and proposed (and expected to pass) last term, before the major oil price drop. Obviously that won\'t have hurt now that oil is a worse investment, but it would probably have passed anyway thanks to all the activism and organising that went on.\n\n- **Some key climate academics pulled their weight**\n\nOne of the breakthroughs for the student divestment campaign was getting some very influential Oxford academics on board pushing for divestment, both publicly and internally. The two notable ones are Myles Allen (climate physicist and lead author of the IPCC 1.5C report) and Cameron Hepburn (Environmental Economics Professor).\n\n- **It\'s also a victory for student direct action**\n\nA small and extremely dedicated student campaign has been pushing for divestment for years, and was a key part of this. You can read their [press release here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wmP1IM134bvoKbv2l-nQjAsblVOBPW0dV08rolGkEu0/edit?fbclid=IwAR0TYhPAnHbmpd1WVyODuRtgzGl7ZZZei3XdybfdvNjzvEeNZ4Die0DxXks). A notable action recently was the occupation of the central quadrangle of St John\'s college (who unfortunately still haven\'t divested). A group (made of students but also supported by XR) literally camped on the grass inside the college for a week, and even brought a big wooden boat (the RSS David Attenborough), which brought much attention and embarrassment to the college for not divesting.\n\n- **On ""engagement"" with fossil fuel companies**\n\nSome divestment motions are basically absolutist statements of intent, which explicitly assume that fossil fuel companies cannot exist in a net-zero emissions world. However some of the [(carefully-worded) language in the motion](https://gazette.web.ox.ac.uk/files/26march2020-no5272pdf) is about ""engaging"" with fossil fuel companies. This means if a company can demonstrate serious progress towards becoming carbon-neutral then the university wouldn\'t consider them to be requiring of divestment. The only (non-greenwashing) way a fossil fuel company could become net-zero in reality is through large-scale deployment geologic Carbon Capture and Storage, and this engagement clause is designed to encourage development of those technologies. Those two academics mentioned in particular have complex and expert views on the role of fossil fuel companies in the future and a lot of the more detailed thought on this point reflects their involvement.\n\n\n- **The real value of the move is hard to quantify**\n\nWhile divesting £3bn is not to be sniffed at, this is possibly even more important as a signal. If Oxford, an international symbol of learning and expertise, thinks fossil fuels should be ditched, then it\'s probably about time. Furthermore, if Oxford University leveraging its academic expertise and industry connections leads to some fossil fuel company breaking rank and seriously developing CCS technology, the impact of that would be measured in Gigatons of CO2. These kind of downstream socio-economic impacts are harder to predict, but potentially where the real value is.', 'As in the British institution or another Oxford?

I\'m still unaware of any plan that requires nuclear that made it through peer review.

No more than I am anti-hydrogen or anti-methanol.  I don\'t see any data or evidence that supports these technologies being able to address our climate needs better than other technologies. I will change my mind as more data comes in. There are many scenarios where I would support more nuclear on the grid. Could SMRs best the expected cost of solar plus storage over their lifetime? Then yes, that\'s a point to discuss. \n\nBut as it is, nuclear is reeling from decades of mismanaged construction and there\'s no conceivable path, in the US, for construction of the large scale plants that are in their article. The most pro-nuclear utilities in the US laugh at the very idea, because of how badly they have been burned financially from nuclear. Until nuclear can solve its financial construction problems, then prove that they have all the other concerns worked out to the satisfaction of neighbors, it has zero future. \n\nWhich is actually OK for the climate, because after decades of tech development, renewables plus storage is cheaper, more flexible, more scalable, more reliable and distributed, and doesn\'t require massive amounts of cooling water. \n\nCall me anti-nuclear, but I was a nuke supporter in 2005 that has soured 100% on this terrible tech as I watched attempted deployments and at the same time the trmendous advancements of other zero carbon tech.

The rule, which would have significantly lowered vehicle emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution, was a cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s policies to combat climate change. The new Trump rule is also expected to revoke the legal authority of California and other states to set their own, stricter, state-level standards.\n\n>Although Mr. Trump has promoted his plan as a gift to the auto industry, automakers have said it could actually harm them by creating regulatory uncertainty as California and other states claimed the legal right to set their own standards and fought back in the courts. Automakers feared that a mix of state and federal pollution standards could split the United States’ auto market, forcing them to make and sell entirely different types of vehicles in different states. \n\n>In striking a deal with California, the automakers are publicly rejecting the Trump plan and following the legal advice of some industry experts who say that it is California, rather than the Trump administration, that is more likely to win the legal battle over climate change pollution. Under the terms of the new deal with California, the automakers selling cars in that state would comply with a slightly looser standard than the original Obama rule. Instead of reaching an average fuel economy of 52.5 miles per gallon by 2025, they would be required to reach a standard of about 51 miles per gallon by 2026. \n\n>In a joint statement, the four automakers said the agreement with California would lead to “much-needed regulatory certainty.” The deal would allow the companies to “meet both federal and state requirements with a single national fleet, avoiding a patchwork of regulations while continuing to ensure meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions,” they said.\n\n>California said that the terms of the deal would give automakers an extra year to improve their fleetwide fuel economy to levels laid out in the Obama-era plan. The deal would also allow them more leeway in meeting those standards through other means, like earning credits for fuel-saving technology.\n\n>“This agreement represents a feasible and acceptable path to accomplishing the goals of California and the automobile industry,” Mary D. Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board, said. “If the White House does not agree, we will move forward with our current standards but work with individual carmakers to implement these principles,” she said. \n\n>“Few issues are more pressing than climate change, a global threat that endangers our lives and livelihoods. California, a coalition of states, and these automakers are leading the way on smart policies that make the air cleaner and safer for us all,” said California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, in a statement. “I now call on the rest of the auto industry to join us, and for the Trump administration to adopt this pragmatic compromise instead of pursuing its regressive rule change. It’s the right thing for our economy, our people and our planet.”\n\n>Some environmental groups criticized the slower pace and expanded loopholes the deal awarded the automakers. “That means more pollution, less savings at the pump and a bad precedent for future standards,” said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based nonprofit group.', ""Essentially.

There's farms and trees all around the area in the literal geographic center of the desert"", '> I am interested in the viability of his restorative grazing approach. \n\nThe problem is that there doesn\'t seem to be. I saw his Ted talk when I was in college and just getting into the whole food production thing. So I was very naive and totally got whisked away, even started raising my own livestock because I was excited to raise animals for ""humanely raised"" protein AND I wanted to help fix the soil where I lived. I figured that a system that he claimed was designed to work against desertification must be the PERFECT model. So when drought hit and I lost all my grass, followed by months of abnormally heavy rains which washed away the last of our top soil (which would have been held in place if the animals hadn\'t destroyed the grass who\'s roots stop erosion) my land would actually be in WAY better shape if I\'d NEVER even tried his method.\n\nI was super depressed about the whole thing, assumed that I\'d horribly fucked up since he was world renowned and all that, but after digging a little deeper, I started finding all these papers about him being basically full of shit and how other people have got burned, begged him to come to their land and help them correct whatever they got wrong, and he just decided to be rude to them and refuse to help.\n\nIt would make sense for graving animals to do better in temperate climates, but the types of weather extremes going on closer to the equator are just getting more severe, both longer and stronger extremes which the plants are struggling to survive, and which totally stress out and endanger livestock. In fact, after going vegan it was the danger to the animals that our local weather poses that led me to totally give them up. I\'ve gone out on various occasions during our more severe stretches of heat wave/drought to find that *someone* had managed to knock the water supply over and my animals were lying on the ground heaving from heat stress, despite being totally fine just that morning. The problem was that even with me buying them big bags of feed and spoiling them with kitchen leftovers, the animals would still eat all the most delicate plants, which meant that they\'d destroy everything in sight, and the moment something new started to grow, they\'d destroy that too. If anything went wrong, like flooding and severe storms, we would suddenly be 100% incapable of moving the animals to a fresh area like the system demands. If you were about to move them when several weeks of heavy rain hit, that meant those animals were stuck in an old, muddy area until the ground finally dried out enough to safely go out and move their tractor or whatever housing system we had them in at the time. So maaaaybe there is a thin chance that if the weather and climate are totally perfect, then his system would work, but that\'s not the type of environment that he advertises his claims are directed towards.\n\nI get what you mean, but a lot of what people *see* as grazing land, *wasn\'t* grazing land before humans showed up. For example the Southern states of the USA and Norther Europe used to be THICK with forests, but now most of those areas have been destroyed for communities, farming, and grazing. The forests that people do see are just a fraction, and mostly of new/young trees where people have allowed the land to regenerate. Specifically the Black Forest in Europe had such big old trees that I\'ve been told ""people would walk for days without seeing the sky"" which is supposedly how it got it\'s name. The way we farm, both graving animals and tilling the soil, which is a technique mostly performed for [grains, 85% of which (in first world countries) is fed to livestock](http://www.fao.org/3/v8180t/v8180T07.htm), seem to do the most harm according to the various papers I\'ve read and what I\'ve witnessed myself. When you consider that 77% of our land is currently spend on livestock who only return a fraction of the protein and calories they use, vs. the world\'s non-animal-feed crops which use only 23% of our land yet support humans with 83% of our calorie supply, and 63% of our protein, while using less water and producing less greenhouse gases or even absorbing the harmful gasses that livestock produce, the whole argument for raising livestock for food starts to dissolve. \n\nSince going vegan I discovered r/veganhomesteading, stopped buying manure, at least in part because [the antibiotics fed to livestock that end up in manure actually harm soil and plant health](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191009093955.htm). Instead my land has been getting mulch and compost that I make with yard and kitchen waste. Since the animals left and I\'ve been using only plant-based inputs I\'ve seen a massive restoration of soil health and plant biodiversity. Wild flowers are growing in places I\'ve never seen them before, the mulch that I made by scattering fallen leaves and chopping up unwanted branches has started to break down into soil, so that when we have serious weather, the remaining soil actually stays in place. New plants that don\'t get constantly trampled or eaten by animals that managed to escape past the fence have developed roots that help rain penetrate the soil instead of turning into run off, and hold the soil in place rather than turning into bald patched like they would when the animals were still involved. I don\'t know if you\'ve ever been in or driven by a cow pasture in the rain, but you\'ll notice that especially around any water sources, they trample the area into sludge that compacts and stops water from penetrating the ground, actually encouraging erosion. Their love for hanging out near water also means that river/stream edges are at the greatest risk of erosion (since all the plant roots are demolished), and they tend to shit and urinate in those areas, meaning more pollution running off into those bodies of water where they can cause fish die offs.\n\n> Perhaps the better approach lies in restoring the wild ecosystem with wolves, elk, and grasses, and then encouraging the reestablishment of the indigenous pastoral practices which have a very long track record of sustainability.\n\nThis! I\'ve more recently been looking into the method that the ancient farmers of South America used, while they lived among their rain forests. For example, trenches that you dump your compost into, and cover up, then you can plant vegetables in the trench section you just covered. This method means that food waste is hidden from animals and breaks down exactly where the plants will need to get their nutrients from. You can also end up with ""volunteers"" if the seeds of anything you threw away decides to grow. Other methods involve capturing water in little canals, that keep the plants watered and help prevent various issues related to having water when you need it. Specifically for dry and desert regions, [Hugelkultur](https://mgsoc.info/2019/01/hugelkultur-what/) seems to have some merit when it comes to fighting desertification. Because it can not only store nutrients and water, but the shapes the mounds form actually help create their own micro climates. Meaning (for example) you can have more drought tolerant plants on the harsher side of the mound, and more delicate plants on the more protected side. When I build berms and swales to help save water/reduce flooding/fight erosion, I actually try to incorporate compost and fallen pieces of wood into the berms to get the same benefits that Hugelkultur has.\n\nI genuinely to believe that we *can* fight desertification, and I really hope my posts didn\'t discourage anyone on that front, but I think a non-animal approach is the best method for multiple reasons: Less of our animals means more resources/space for wild animals who can help re-balance the environment better than any human scheme could. Focusing on adding mulch and compost from our own waste would help replenish what animal agriculture is constantly stealing from the environment without the concern of [over-supplementing with animal waste which causes thousands of fish deaths](https://www.toledoblade.com/news/state/2017/08/24/Poor-manure-practices-culprit-in/stories/20170824213) and [causes dead zones in our oceans](https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-meat-affects-environment-dead-zone-2018-4).

But you kinda didn\'t feel like paying a little more tax so governments could help people put up solar panels, so instead they voted for the guy who was going to ""keep jobs"" and expand the pipelines. Your grandparents just didn\'t really care. \n\nWhat do you think of them?\n\nThat\'s who we are, and what we do in the next decade will be our legacy. This isn\'t the time for making people ""feel good"" about how much we change our lives. We can\'t put up solar panels and claim ourselves a champion of the environment, then still go on trips to tourist traps and cruises every year, buy bananas in January, and eat beef every night for dinner. It\'s just not good enough. \n\nThe time isn\'t to tell people ""good job, you tried"". The time is to slap them in the face and tell them to do more. This isn\'t a turtle sticker on grade 2 drawing. This is life and death of our future generations, and the extinction of millions of species.', 'It\'s honestly flabbergasting to me that people think ""oh well, our political system won\'t change fast enough, I guess I\'ll just die then""... instead of ... changing our political system. Like you said, what\'s easier to change... the bipartisan political system that pits 2 sides against eachother yelling at eachother - more concerned with defamation of the other candidate than talking about what we\'re actually going to do to survive? Or a planet that our grandkids can breathe the air, and grow food on, and the mass extinction of animals. We are already making 80-200 species go extinct every day. How many of those are linchpins in their ecosystems? We haven\'t even catagorized all the nematodes, yet we spray nemicide on crops because SOME nematodes eat plant roots. It\'s experimentation on a global scale and it\'s terrifying. Insect collapse increased 3700% last year, yet only 16 countries have banned neonectinoids.\n\nWe need to unite and solve this, not say ""our party is doing more than their party, so I guess vote for us"", then they get elected and don\'t even do anything. Or even worse, take money from industry and expand pipelines. It\'s straight up criminal.\n\nWe either beat this or we don\'t. There are no participation ribbons. ""Our political system is slow"" isn\'t good enough, because we don\'t beat this with that attitude. And it\'s not just global warming, we are facing multiple existential threats from multiple angles.\n\nThis is a fucking hospital issue. When you need to get to the hospital you GET TO THE HOSPITAL. You don\'t ask work if you can take the day off. You don\'t worry about picking up the mail to pay your bills. Hell, you don\'t even worry about piddly things like a red light. Sure you\'ll stop, but if it\'s clear both ways and nobody is there, you are going to run the fucking light and get to the hospital. Rules are rules until it\'s a matter of survival. Climate change is a hospital issue. We need all hands on deck, and we need to get to the hospital. Now.\n\nThe thing I\'m most afraid is groups like Exinction Rebellion. They are the nicest versions of what protest groups will look like. What do people think will start happening if governments keep destroying the planet to line their pockets and that of  big industry? It\'s going to get violent. Like really fucking violent.\n\nI don\'t want us to get there.\n\nWe need to act now if we are going to have a chance in hell of avoiding that.\n\nThe funny thing is, the same political groups in the US that don\'t believe in climate change are the ones that want to build a wall to stop illegal immigration. What happens when entire countries based on food based economy become uninhabitable and flee their countries? There will be a refugee crisis like the world has never seen before.\n\nMy PM just announced Canada will be carbon neutral by 2050. First off, that\'s not enough. Secondly he said his party is the one to tackle the climate change. But... the dude just expanded pipelines for oil and gas. So yeah, I don\'t believe him. We need more. It\'s not enough, and I\'m sorry if this offends people, but it\'s not. This isn\'t a turtle sticker on a grade 2 drawing. It\'s not a participation ribbon. We either beat this or we lose 4 billion people to starvation and make half the world\'s species go extinct, flood the planet, and destroy the oceans almost completely. We already have dead zones the size of countries, we already have phytoplankton collapsing. Their CO2 sequestration reduction isn\'t modeled in the IPCC reports, but they are actively collapsing. We already have 50 years of topsoil remaining due to industrial agriculture monocropping. When are we actually going to stand up and say enough is enough?

And I emphasize a hierarchy here: The way the human world works is unavoidably tied to the way the natural world works. It is pointless to pretend the human world would be something fixed which we have to work around. On the contrary, the human world is that part of the world over which we have the most control, which is the most flexible. If we want, we can. A stable climate is something we have to regard as fixed, and work around that, to make that possible, to ensure that. Whatever sacrifice is necessary to achieve it is necessary.\n\nEffectiveness is something we have to care about. We need certain things to reach certain goals. If we do not want 200 million climate refugees by 2050, we have to meet certain goals by 2025. Of course it is nice when governments make *promises* what they want to have achieved by 2030, but if that means to miss that goal then our judgement has to somehow incorporate that being ineffective, missing goals, means suffering beyond anything we\'ve seen before and should be unacceptable given that we can do better.\n\nWhich is what I expressed:\n\n> **Good**, but too little too late.\n\nWe should still tell the truth.

Positive feedback amplifies the change in the first quantity while negative feedback reduces it.The term ""forcing"" means a change which may ""push"" the climate system in the direction of warming or cooling.

It\'s like smashing open a piggy bank full of water, then trying to glue it back together before the water spills out. If cracks in the permafrost starts letting methane out, those cracks are there. They won\'t re-solidify if we cool. Sure, some water WILL resolidify, but the cracks emitting a constant flow of volatized gas will not re-freeze.\n\nFor methane, it has a halflife of about 9 years where it reverts back to CO2. People often say that methane is 30 times worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, but that\'s because those numbers take into account the short halflife. Infact methane is 84 times worse in the first 20 years, and then tails off, to make a 100 year average of 30x worse.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nShakhova et al. (2008) estimate that not less than 1,400 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon is presently locked up as methane and methane hydrates under the Arctic submarine permafrost, and 5–10% of that area is subject to puncturing by open taliks. They conclude that ""release of up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of hydrate storage [is] highly possible for abrupt release at any time"". That would increase the methane content of the planet\'s atmosphere **by a factor of twelve**.\n\nSo 50Gt is subject to leaking at any point in a very acute, non-chronic way. That\'s enough to 12x where we are today. There is no less than 1400 Gt more, and who is to say we don\'t release more like 100, or 200, or 500.

But who knows.\n\nAs for passively blasting IR into space, I first learnt about the idea in this TED talk: https://youtu.be/7a5NyUITbyk\nThey already have a business that sells cooling machines (mostly for Australia) that use this technology http://skycoolsystems.com/\nBut the principle is ancient, see\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling\n\n> In India before the invention of artificial refrigeration technology, ice making by nocturnal cooling was common. The apparatus consisted of a shallow ceramic tray with a thin layer of water, placed outdoors with a clear exposure to the night sky. The bottom and sides were insulated with a thick layer of hay. On a clear night the water would lose heat by radiation upwards. Provided the air was calm and not too far above freezing, heat gain from the surrounding air by\xa0convection\xa0was low enough to allow the water to freeze.[3]\xa0A similar technique was used in Iran as well.[4\n\nThe idea is that you choose a combination of materials that emit IR in a wavelength which the atmosphere doesn\'t absorb much of. That way, the surface is always losing a bit of heat, which disappears from the planet. The modern versions described in the TED talks are more efficient, but in a pinch, the classical ones can be more easily built by non-experts even in a rather chaotic society.\n\nAs for if the cooling effects of such ""simple"" efforts are sufficient to compensate for, say, all the methane in the Tundra, I know far too little to know, but my guess would of course be that it would be far, far from sufficient. In that scenario, we would certainly need more powerful forms of cooling. Aerosols can cool the planet very much, but this most likely has very significant negative side effects so it should really only be used in a pinch.', ""It won't re-freeze because think of what a raindrop does when it tries to land on top of an air compressor nozzle blasting air out of it. \n\nAnd for the last part, that's the entire point. The amount of methane in there is so large that it's impossible for us to reverse it. \n\nRight now, we can pull CO2 out of the air with plants. We can stop emitting it. This is really super duper easy. I planted thousands of trees this year, and I could easily do more if that was my job. I could easily do a million in a year - I did 300 in a few hours, and I was babying them. \n\nIf we take it further with seeds, it's super easy to scatter millions of seeds and have thousands germinate. It's super easy to just not cut trees down. Or better yet, strategically coppice an emergent forest, to stimulate new vegetative growth, release light in glades, increase edge in the forest, mix in not just trees but carbon sequestering grasses like vetiver. We know these things, we can do these things very cheaply. \n\nSo we can do all these things and they are super easy to do (relatively speaking). So if we fail to even do something as simple as planting trees, not cutting down trees, choosing not to vacation, then what confidence do we have that we can invent, create, manufacture, distribute and put to work technology to cool the planet against a methane bomb from the permafrost? I have zero.\n\nWe can fix this now, because CO2 is an easy. It's so easy it's a joke. Plants naturally pull it out, we just need to stop pumping carbon out, and plant more plants. Super simple. Once we swap from CO2 being the main problem to CH4, we now straight up lose. CO2 is super easy to pull out of the air with plants. CH4, not so much. \n\nAll that aside though, the main issue is just pure quantity. The quantity of methane trapped under the permafrost. It's just too much. \n\nThen also the ice melting itself turns the ice from largely a solar reflector (ice has a terrible thermal storage capacity), to water, which is one of the most efficient thermal mass storage devices. The color (white vs blue) also impacts radiative heat capture. \n\nThere are just so many feedback loops, I'm not even confident we understand them all. Specifically regarding cliff edge effects and soil microbiology, soil nutrient chelation, plant root exudates, soil water retention impacted by loss of soil organic matter, fungal mycelium collapse and nutrient/water transfer and communication pathways, there's so much we only kind of sort of know, that are all on the brink of collapse. \n\nIncreasing the methane concentration in the air isn't just an energy in-energy out problem. It's implications stretch far beyond that to biological implications and crashing of entire ecosystems, and could go so far as to make our planet incapable of growing food outside of a laboratory. \n\nThen take it further - our bodies are nothing more than spaceships to carry bacteria around. We only exist because we have a symbiotic relationship with the organisms inside of us - which outnumber our own cells. Yes, you are more non-human than human, on a cell basis. We barely understand any of this stuff, but we threaten the collapse of it."", 'Desktop link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling\n***\n ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^281567.

For what it’s worth, carbon takes a century to take out of the atmosphere. Nuclear waste will take millions of years to degrade. ', "">There are ways we can recycle it or use it in other reactors. The thing about spent nuclear fuel is that it still has a lot of useful fuel and isotope in it. \n\nThose are breeder reactors and they produce plutonium, which presents it's own slew of problems. Not an ideal solution. \n\n>For what's left, I really don't think putting it in a mountain is the worst idea. If we process it to pull out all of the useful isotopes, we will have less wast, and that wast will be less dangerous.\n\nThe waste will be more dangerous, not less. Picking a place to put the spent fuel isn't nearly as easy as just sticking it in a mountain somewhere, you have to make serious considerations about tectonic activity and future tectonic activity, as an example. "", 'The ""uses waste"" thing is super oversimplified unfortunately.\n\nOne company making these claims had to back down on these claims after their own professors smacked them down.\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/603731/nuclear-energy-startup-transatomic-backtracks-on-key-promises/\n\n""asserted that its molten-salt reactor design could run on spent nuclear fuel from conventional reactors and generate energy far more efficiently than they do. In a white paper published in March 2014, the company proclaimed its reactor “can generate up to 75 times more electricity per ton of mined uranium than a light-water reactor.”""\n\n""the company downgraded “75 times” to “more than twice.” In addition, it now specifies that the design “does not reduce existing stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel” or use them as its fuel source.""\n\nThe thing everyone forgets to mention about reusing spent fuel in MSRs is you need to reprocess it first. Standard used nuke fuel is noble-metal clad urania pellets of various enrichments depending on the reactor design. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel\n\nAfter irradiation and use in a normal reactor, you mostly have uranium left inside, but the x% that has undergone fission and/or neutron capture is extremely active. Some U238 becomes Pu239/Pu240/Pu241 from catching some neutrons. The reason it is considered spent is the shit formed absorbs neutrons so well that it makes it very difficult to use in the reactor. When they say they can reuse spent fuel, they don\'t refer to what would be the ideal case, simply taking out a spent rod from a traditional reactor and adding it to the molten salt reactor. They need to separate out the most benign as well as useful isotopes, those of uranium and plutonium generally. The way they do this involves dissolving all the spent fuel in acid, which if done too soon can release a ton of volatile isotopes into the atmosphere (eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run where a huge area of washington state was exposed to airborne releases of I131 causing tons of cancer cases)\n\nSo normally they cool it for a few years first. The chemical process of turning spent solid fuel pellets into a MSR-compatible fuel (uranium chlorides) results in tons of high-level, aqueous nuclear waste which is actually harder to safely store long term and is a larger environmental risk than spent fuel.\n\nImagine you spill a few pellets of spent fuel outside; whatever, they are pellets, you (or your remote robot, better plan) can pick them up and put them away semi-safely (caveat: it takes you years to do it and it oxidizes to more environmentally-mobile forms, then cleanup is much harder). Reprocessing waste is solution based, the shit they are still dealing with at Hanford, after leaking into the river for decades. Compare a spill of this to trying to clean milk up off your lawn; its not going to happen, and it will spread much more readily through groundwater movement.\n\nSo naturally every location with an extensive nuclear reprocessing history is an environmental nightmare. For example Mayak, russia reprocesses spent nuclear fuel and is pretty much the most polluted spot on the planet: http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/radwaste-storage-at-nuclear-fuel-cycle-plants-in-russia/2011-12-russias-infamous-reprocessing-plant-mayak-never-stopped-illegal-dumping-of-radioactive-waste-into-nearby-river-poisoning-residents-newly-disclosed-court-finding-says\n\n""Between 2001 and 2004, around 30 million to 40 million cubic meters of radioactive waste ended in the river Techa, near the reprocessing facility, which “caused radioactive contamination of the environment with the isotope strontium-90.” The area is home to between 4,000 and 5,000 residents. Measurements taken near the village Muslyumovo, which suffered the brunt of both the 1957 accident and the radioactive discharges in the 1950s, showed that the river water – as per guidelines in the Sanitary Rules of Management of Radioactive Waste, of 2002 – “qualified as liquid radioactive waste.”""\n\nAnd the entry of reprocessing waste into the environment created a lake so polluted you can\'t even stand near it without getting a lethal dose: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Karachay\n\n""Karachay is the most polluted place on Earth from a radiological point of view.[2] The lake accumulated some 4.44 exabecquerels (EBq) of radioactivity over less than one square mile of water,[3] including 3.6 EBq of caesium-137 and 0.74 EBq of strontium-90.[4] For comparison, the Chernobyl disaster released 0.085 EBq of caesium-137, a much smaller amount and over thousands of square miles. (The total Chernobyl release is estimated between 5 to 12 EBq of radioactivity, however essentially only caesium-134/137 [and to a lesser extent, strontium-90] contribute to land contamination because the rest is too short-lived). The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly 11 feet (3.4 m).\n\nThe radiation level in the region near where radioactive effluent is discharged into the lake was 600 röntgens per hour (approximately 6 Sv/h) in 1990, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council,[5][6] sufficient to give a lethal dose to a human within an hour. ""\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_of_Lake_Karachay\n\n""The pollution of Lake Karachay is connected to the disposal of nuclear materials from Mayak. Among workers, cancer mortality remains an issue.[5] By the time Mayak\'s existence was officially recognized, there had been a 21% rise in cancer cases, a 25% rise in birth defects, and a 41% rise in leukemia in the surrounding region of Chelyabinsk.[6] By one estimate, the river contains 120 million curies of radioactive waste.[7]""\n\nHanford, Washington is nearly as bad but the US took moderately more precautions so its mostly contained in leaky tanks. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hanford-nuclear-cleanup-problems/\n\nYes, hanford is weapons waste, not nuclear power reactor waste, but the exact same chemical processes are used to extract usable isotopes from spent fuel for use in new power plants, vs bombs (you just leave the fuel in a reactor shorter for weapons, that way Pu240 does not build up too much, and Pu240 complicates weapons design).\n\nNot only does reprocessing make nuke waste more easily spread in the environment, it also is a weapons proliferation risk; any facility doing reprocessing for power reactors can easily use the same equipment for extraction of weapons grade plutonium. The US banned domestic reprocessing specifically to slow the spread of the tech to countries that would use it for weapons programs.\n\nAnd after all that, reprocessed fuel is more expensive than fresh, so there is no economic incentive to use spent fuel if new is cheaper. Rokkasho in Japan is the only large scale civil fuel reprocessing plant where costs are fully available. Hanford, Mayak, Sellafield, La Hague are all so involved with the weapons industries over their history that costs are impossible to find, and more outdated designs than Rokkasho anyway. Rokkasho has not even opened yet and its lifecycle costs are estimated at over 106B.

However, the infrastructure which delivers energy services can break down in an energy accident, sometimes causing much damage, and energy fatalities can occur, and with many systems often deaths will happen even when the systems are working as intended.\n\nHistorically, coal mining has been the most dangerous energy activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one. Underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions.\n\n***\n\n**Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents**\n\nA nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as ""an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility."" Examples include lethal effects to individuals, radioactive isotope to the environment, or reactor core melt."" The prime example of a ""major nuclear accident"" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactive isotopes are released, such as in the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954, and has been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. Technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted, however human error remains, and ""there have been many accidents with varying impacts as well near misses and incidents"". As of 2014, there have been more than 100 serious nuclear accidents and incidents from the use of nuclear power. Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and about 60% of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the USA. Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClimateActionPlan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28', ""The can also be offline at night, or when it isn't windy.  \n\n\nNot a great power source, frankly."", 'While I don’t think most nuclear supporters encourage this kind of recklessness, you’re right in that there is a **serious lack of concern over groundwater risks** for long term underground storage.\n\nTerrorist attacks, natural disaster(think Houston’s flooding/crazy wildfires), produce a huge latent risk on top of the **total unfeasibility of being able to effectively manage nuclear waste produced for 318million Americans for the next 100 or even 70 years.\n\nSpace is already so hard to come by for construction, and this doesn’t even take into consideration the difficulty for underground storage in most areas due to water/electrical infrastructure.\n\n\n**however, it’d be nice wouldn’t it if we had a better solution.** oh wait we do!\n*Solar/Wind/Geothermal/Biofuel/Hydroelectric*\n\nAnd these don’t produce irradiated waste products for the next 3 generations to figure out how to deal with! *how quaint* ', 'It\'s true, there is no ""great"" solution for spent nuclear fuel, although 4th generation reactors would hopefully produce even less of it.\n\nHowever, we are at a point in history where we have to make a choice between pest and cholera, as we say in German.

Death rates are lower than modeled in the BAU settings, but population growth remains on point, and you cannot deny the trend lines for death and birth rates.  \n\n\nSeondly, pollution is not going down, and if you\'d read in depth you\'d see that they are using co2 levels as well as other forms of pollution.  Even \\*just\\* basing it on co2 levels would be entirely accurate, since those are (in case you missed this) rising.  They went up last year, and up from the year before that. We just hit past 415ppm in the atmosphere.  Things are not getting better in this regard, globally, only worse.   \n\n\nThirdly, to repeat, because you may have forgotten, ""In some runs, they gave World3 unlimited, non-polluting nuclear energy -  which allowed extensive substitution and recycling of limited materials  - and a doubling in the reserves of nonrenewables that could be  economically exploited. All the same, the population crashed when  industrial pollution soared. Then fourfold pollution reductions were  added as well: this time, the crash came when there was no more  farmland.""  \n\n\nSo let me ask you--do renewables currently account for a hypothetical future where we have unlimited non polluting energy?  The answer is no.  Governments and oil companies currently control enough oil reserves to get Earth past a 2 C warming hundreds of times over.  Do you \\*really\\* think they are going to not burn it and leave \\*trillions of dollars of oil in the ground\\*?  No.  They won\'t.  Our economy is not going to do that, and as such, we are going to burn all that oil. Or most of it.  Even if we burned half of it, we still push earth to past 2C, and that is catastrophic, and carries with it...collapse of ecosystems, agriculture, and then we see all those World3 trendlines coming true. You\'re looking for the trendlines to be 100% exact, today,  in order to believe them, and that wasn\'t their intention.  The direction and \\*trend\\* is what is important.  They modeled thousands of outcomes.  \n\n\nYou seem to have forgotten, too, that ""in the real world there are delays before limits are understood, institutions act or remedies take effect.  These delayed responses were programmed into World3. The model crashed because its hypothetical people did not respond to the mounting problems before underlying support systems, such as farmland and ecosystems, had  been damaged.\n\nInstead, they carried on consuming and polluting past the point the model world could sustain. The result was what economists call a bubble and\xa0*Limits*\xa0called overshoot. The impact of these response delays was ""the fundamental  scientific message"" of the study, says Randers. Critics, and even fans  of the study, he says, didn\'t get this point.\n\nThe other message missed was that Limits was about how catastrophe could be averted. It did not say that humanity was doomed.  In model runs where growth of population and industry were constrained,  growth did level out rather than collapse - the stabilised scenario.""  \n\n\nHowever, no current model realistically shows us getting to that. Which brings me back to my original point; Growth and mitigating climate change are incompatible.  \n\n\nThis is the reality. The time for a magic tech solution was 30 years ago.  Geo Engineering might have some promise, but it\'s a brutal and terrifying idea in its own right.', ""I did read it and they only addressed maybe 2 of them, which I still voiced my concerns about. Literally this entire model is based off of oil. Oil is everything to this model, and even in the alternative energy production they don't mention any type of renewables. Sorry, I just don't buy it at all. You can however, but it just doesn't add up or make sense to me."", ""Lastly, The original\xa0*Limits*\xa0team put out\xa0[an updated study using World3](http://www.earthscan.co.uk/?tabid=1370)\xa0in 2005, which included faster-falling birth rates. Except in the stabilising scenario, World3 still collapsed. And  while the model was too pessimistic about birth and death rates, it was  too optimistic about the future impact of pollution. We now know that  overshoot - the delayed response to problems that makes the effects so  much worse - will eventually be especially catastrophic for climate  change, because the full effects of greenhouse gases will not be  apparent for centuries.\n\nThere  will be no more sequels based on World3, though. The model can no  longer serve its purpose, which was to show us how to avoid collapse.  Starting from \\[today's\\] current conditions, no plausible assumptions  produce any result but overshoot."", ""There's a lot wrong with this but I only have time for one, so this is the last time I'll respond to you oceanboy. Population trends are the only one they REALLY got right, but those have been predicted for some time now, this model isn't special because of it.\n\n415PPM is a relatively arbitrary number, and it will keep going up as long as we are polluting. And I never said it was going down, I said it won't spike, but choose to ignore that for the sake of your all telling model.\n\nHere's where we have an inherent difference - you seem to think that no one is good in politics or industry and that they all want to see the world burn.

And the fact that they programmed in the delayed responses itself shows bias and shows a solution. But again choose to ignore we have made strides in these matters because well - it fits your model.\n\nAlso for the record, I'm not looking for the trendlines to be exact, but they started straying more and more around 2000.

And any temperature rise above what’s already inevitable would pose a severe risk of melting the methane-infused Arctic permafrost, thus releasing 283 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere — a development that, when combined with the disappearance of heat-deflecting ice, would rapidly accelerate global warming and all but doom human civilization.\n\nbut yeah...I'm just an alarmist."", 'The permafrost release is pretty negligable if you do the math on it, and the aldebo effect can be replicated. Plus if we\'re going by that article we wouldn\'t see permafrost release until like 2100. Plus the IPCC even said we wouldn\'t see anyone on ""track"" to beat the accords until around 2025 with the given circumstances. Now if what you said did happen, and we kept releasing (so we hit at least 3.2C by the end of the century) then yeah I\'d be worried about us, but I severely doubt we release even close to this amount by 2050 and after. But someone could always prove me wrong so ya know', ""The math on the permafrost is by no means negligible. What numbers are you using?\n\nThe IPCC report and Paris accord are incredibly overly optimistic and that commits the world to a target that means the death of hundreds of millions if not more. \n\nEven the commitments made by countries in the Paris accord don't get us to a 2 degree world.\n\nThe 2 degree target is now unattainable (unless of course the entirety of civilization does a 180 today...) and is based on geo-engineering the climate of the earth as well as the sequestering of every molecule of carbon we have produced since 1987, as well as every molecule we are producing today,as well as every molecule we produce tomorrow.... with magical technologies that don't exist, wont exist and, even if they did would likely cause as many if not more problems than they fix.\n\nThe 2 degree target of the IPCC *does not factor in the feedback loops such as the increase absorption of heat due to a drastic reduction in the albedo effect caused by the 70% loss of arctic ice*,..- or as mentioned the release of methane from a thawing arctic. (there is more energy stored in the arctic methane than there is in coal in the world). If the process of the release of the methane, currently frozen in the soil and ocean beds of the arctic, which may have already begun, but if it spins out of control we are looking a an 8 degree rise in temperature. \n\nThe report which gives us 12 years to get our head's out of our arses underestimated the amount of heat stored in the world's oceans, as we discovered in mid-January by 40%... so no, we don't have 12 more years.\n\nThe conservative, American Meteorological Society indicates that our willful blindness and greed will have effects well beyond the climate. The worlds oceans will see a 150% increase in acidity and over a full degree Celsius in warming. This well down the path to the Permian extinction where 96% of marine species disappeared forever.\n\nThe IPCC report ignores the effects of humans messing up the Nitrogen cycle through agricultural fertilizers and more.\n\nLiterally every metric is happening faster than predicted, and our response is laughably under what is needed, even with current projects underway. \n\nThis is the reality."", 'The IPCC isn\'t ""overly optimistic"" so I\'m not sure where you got that notion. 2 degrees is not unattainable, and neither is under 2. If you go by how much it\'s been heating (the same rate throughout the decades by the way, it doesn\'t ""speed up"") then if we follow the IPCC papers, and are carbon negative after 2050 then under 2 IS ATTAINABLE. This is how it works, however at this current rate it seems like we won\'t hit under 2. And it never ""requires"" geoengineering, it just talks about it as a potential solution. And sequestration isn\'t a ""magical solution"" it fucking exists so while it\'s no magic bullet, ignoring it is pretty unscientific and purposefully misleading. Again I\'m not sure where everyone keeps getting this idea that they don\'t factor in feedback loops. They even say that melting ice resulting in less reflecting is a large factor in heating, but since it doesn\'t say ""feedback"" for you to catch on I guess you just didn\'t notice. \n\nAs for the methane, this comment summarizes it pretty well, it\'s referring to NASAs page on the permafrost:\n\n""The first thing I look for in such an article are the numbers. In this case, they are found in these sentences:\n\n(Using a combination of computer models and field measurements... researchers found that abrupt thawing more than doubles previous estimates of permafrost-derived greenhouse warming. They found that the abrupt thaw process increases the release of ancient carbon stored in the soil 125 to 190 percent compared to gradual thawing alone.)\n\nSo they are saying that later this century, if their hypothesis is correct, the methane contribution from the Arctic will be 2-3 times greater than it would be if their hypothesis is incorrect. Let\'s put this in context.\n\n1. Methane represents about 15% of the change in radiative forcing from GHGs over the last century. ^1\n\n2. Atmospheric methane increased more rapidly during the 20th century than it has this century, both in absolute terms and in terms of percent of total methane. ^2\n\n3. Methane has a halflife of about 8.6 years. That means that of a given quantity of methane released into the atmosphere today, half will remain in 8.6 years, a quarter in 17.2 years, an eighth in 25.8 years, etc. ^3\n\n4. More methane is released from cows, natural wetlands, rice paddies, or biomass burning than is released from the permafrost. ^4\n\n5. More methane is released from leaks in gas lines than is released from the permafrost. ^4\n\n6. The forcing from methane follows the square root of concentration. ^5\n\nPutting all of this together, then, says that the future change in radiative forcing due to Arctic methane will be marginal. Even if more methane is released from permafrost than is currently observed, that can be offset by changing how we grow rice or better monitoring of gas lines or even changing what we feed cows.\n\n-----\n\nhttp://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/pns/current_ghg.html\n\nhttp://www.methanelevels.org/\n\nhttps://www.scitechnol.com/peer-review/fugitive-methane-and-the-role-of-atmospheric-halflife-u53c.php?article_id=6097\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02208779\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL071930 ""\n\nSo yeah not sure where you get your numbers but uh... Yeah.\n\nAnd if you\'re referring to cathrate gun don\'t even fucking respond, that shit was debunked a long time ago, and even by people trying to prove it right, it\'s still considered unlikely. \n\nNot gonna argue about the ocean, the ocean is gonna have a tough time to say the very least. And no the IPCC report doesn\'t ignore it, it takes into account all positive and negative feedbacks, many of which you are also ignoring. And not every metric is happening faster. If it were we would have seen less sea ice today than we saw 7 years ago at it\'s lowest. The earth has been heating the same rate, it\'s not exponential. And if you\'re gonna tell me phytoplankton are dying faster you also haven\'t done your research. Yes some things will happen faster, but not every metric, especially heating is happening fast enough to warrant what you are saying.\n\nEdit: I can understand saying the IPCC understated the amount of energy growth, but that\'s about it, nothing is going to significantly increase emissions or warming any time soon besides a potential ""cathrate gun"" which has not only been disproved but is considered unlikely by those who research this. However there are many unknown positive and negative feedbacks that could trigger that we don\'t know of. But what we do know is there\'s nothing like that happening. It will just get warmer and warmer and worse and worse as it goes on. And it\'s relatively gradual too. And with the ocean warming there are 100% ways to cool it.

So for anybody wondering what's going on, this sub just went from roughly under 600 people to over 13,250 in the matter of 9 hours.

Thanks to everybody who's joined. I'm a very busy person so I apologize that this sub isn't more visually appealing like some other subs are.

So a VERY quick run down:

This sub is all about what progress is being made in the fight against climate change along with any adaptation that is being done until we can fully reverse the effects. This is not a sub for posts about the Green New Deal, how we're doomed, political posts, etc. This is entirely about progress being done, not what progress could be done. 

I'm very lenient when it comes to bans. I don't care what your religion or political affiliation is. It's ok for those not very well knowledgeable to come in here and to ask questions in a non-concern trolling way. I just had to explain to my cousin about positive feedback loops and climate change in general because he really didn't know anything about it, but he never really denied it.  Progress isn't made by calling the ""other side"" names. 

So being a anti-science prick on here, or just being a dick on here, will result in a very long ban.

(NASA climatologist [James Hansen agrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAW1A6Ca8), btw). \n\nHere are some things I\'ve done since I started:\n\n* I\'ve talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price). I\'ve convinced several that a carbon tax is a good idea. I\'ve convinced a few to start volunteering for carbon taxes. [34% of Americans would be willing to volunteer for an organization to convince elected officials to act on climate change](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf). If you feel like you\'re up against a wall in your own political conversations, [here\'s some short trainings on how to have better political conversations](https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/communications/how-to-have-better-political-conversations/). The IPCC has been clear that [carbon pricing is **necessary**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf), and [talking about climate change has been scientifically shown to be effective at increasing policy support](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/30/14804). \n\n* It took a few tries, but I published [a Letter to the Editor](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/111) to the largest local paper in my area espousing the need for and benefits of a carbon tax. Maybe you don\'t read LTEs, but [Congress does](https://www.aclu.org/other/letters-editor-how-write-them-and-why-they-work). \n\n* I\'ve joined several [organized call-in days](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/text/) asking Congress to take climate change seriously and pass Carbon Fee & Dividend. [These phone calls work](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf), but it will take [at least 100 of us per district](https://republicen.quorum.us/campaign/11713/) to pass a U.S. bill. \n\n* I wrote to [my favorite podcast](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) about carbon taxes asking them to talk about [the scientific](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economic](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) consensus on their show.

Eventually [they released this episode](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/573) (and [this blog post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/economics-renewables-and-climate-change/)) lauding the benefits of carbon taxes.  \n\n* I\'ve written literally dozens of [letters to my Rep and Senators](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/write-your-representative/) over the last few years asking them to support Carbon Fee & Dividend. I\'ve seen their responses change over the years, too, so I suspect it\'s working (in fairness, [I\'m not the only one](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/accomplishments/), of course). [Over 90% of members of Congress are swayed by contact from constituents](http://www.congressfoundation.org/projects/communicating-with-congress/citizen-centric-advocacy-2017). \n\n* I\'ve hosted or co-hosted 4 letter-writing parties so that I could invite people I know to take [meaningful and effective action](http://www.congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-citizen-centric-advocacy.pdf) on climate change.\n\n* At my request, 5 businesses and 2 non-profits have signed [Influencer\'s Letters to Congress](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/leaders/) calling for Carbon Fee & Dividend. \n\n* I recruited a friend to help me write a municipal Resolution for our municipality to publicly support Carbon Fee & Dividend. It took a lot of hard work recruiting volunteers from all over the city, sometimes meeting 2-3 times with the same Council member, but eventually it passed unanimously. [Over 100 municipalities have passed similar Resolutions in support of Carbon Fee & Dividend that call on Congress to pass the legislation](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/endorsements/municipal/). \n\n* I\'ve [tabled](https://community.citizensclimate.org/resources/item/19/290) at several events, usually collecting letters from constituents to their members of Congress\n\n* I started a Meetup in my area to help recruit and train more volunteers who are interested in making this dream a reality.

Meanwhile, there are like a dozen countries in Africa who are gaining more than +25 people per thousand per year. \n\nSo how might RNI play out in a climate change scenario? \n\nWell, we can probably start with the assumption that poorer countries with high RNI, especially those around equitorial latitudes, are least likely to be able to adapt to the worst of climate change. War, famine, disease and active or passive genocidal die-offs due to mass migration could conceivably wipe those countries out over teh course of several decades. If those equitorial latitudes then become uninhabitable over that period, as is generally expected, their RNI will drop to pretty much zero.\n\nIn that scenario, the long-term question of RNI then depends on what happens in the wealthier countries during that same period. If they\'re able to maintain their technological and infrastructural sophistication, it\'s conceivable that global RNI could more or less permanently drop very low to what we see in France or Germany today.\n\nBut it\'s all terrifically hypothetical. Anything can happen, and collapse is unlikely to be evenly distributed.', '[deleted]', '/r/thanosdidnothingwrong', 'Just 50 per cent of developed countries would be enough', 'Mycelium is quicker and more efficient than trees for carbon sequestration.

In my understanding, this is because populations that have seen rapid increases will tend to continue to increase more by virtue of a demographic bulge in people of child-bearing age, but that increase will reduce in cycles over a couple of generations, until it levels off at sustainable levels so long as material conditions continue to be met. In fact, population growth has been slowing for at least the past 10 years.\n\n[Oxfam has a great rundown from 2009 which also explicitly debunks the supposed link between population growth and GHG emissions.](https://oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/population-why-its-a-dangerous-distraction-on-climate-change-and-makes-us-feel-uncomfortable/)', ""Plenty of others?\n\nThere's mostly China, and we can set aside that China's per-capita emissions are well below the West's because despite their insistence otherwise, China's dominant economic system is state-capitalism, not communism.

In that scenario global RNI could well go negative.\n\nBut yes, regardless of that thought experiement, a drastic population decline would be unhinged from climate change itself.

No, concluded the tweeters, but Tyler Cowen begged to differ (http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/09/do-all-serious-economists-favor-a-carbon-tax.html) . Mr Cowen writes that he personally favours a carbon tax but can imagine a number of principled reasons other economists might not.\n\n> Why would we expect economists to support a carbon tax? It\'s very close to the economic ideal. Global warming is a phenomenon associated with emissions of greenhouse gases over and above natural cycles—largely those resulting from the burning of carbon fuels humans have dug up out of the ground. We expect normal economic activity to maximise social good because each individual balances costs and benefits when making economic decisions. Carbon emissions represent a negative externality. When an individual takes an economic action with some fossil-fuel energy content—whether running a petrol-powered lawnmower, turning on a light, or buying bunch of grapes—that person balances their personal benefits against the costs of the action. The cost to them of the climate change resulting from the carbon content of that decisions, however, is effectively zero and is rationally ignored. The decision to ignore carbon content, when aggregated over the whole of humanity, generates huge carbon dioxide emissions and rising global temperatures.\n \n> The economic solution is to tax the externality so that the social cost of carbon is reflected in the individual consumer\'s decision. The carbon tax is an elegant solution to a complicated problem, which allows the everyday business of consumer decision making to do the work of emission reduction. It\'s by no means the only economically sensible policy response to the threat of climate change, but it is the one we\'d expect economists to embrace.\n\n> Mr Cowen argues for caution on this point for several reasons. A carbon tax will be less effective if it\'s not universally applied, potentially leading to carbon leakage to countries with looser environmental rules. He worries that where carbon fees have been applied innovation has not been quick to respond. He fears that good substitutes for carbon fuels don\'t exist, especially in the transport sector, and worries that higher fuel prices might harm the economy. He suggests that a ""green-energy subsidies first"" policy might make more sense, and he talks about distributional and rent-seeking costs of the policy.\n\n> I think the weakness of these arguments is telling, and it\'s not surprising that Mr Cowen continues to support a carbon tax. What if a carbon price doesn\'t immediately drive emission reductions? Then the tax will be an effective revenue raiser, much more efficient than a tax on income. Either way you win. The worry about carbon leakage is a real one, but this dynamic also implies that each new country that prices carbon increases the benefit of existing carbon-price policies in other countries.\n\n> Substitution in the transport sector is somewhat problematic, but a viable carbon price would not have much effect on petrol costs at the outset. A carbon tax of $30 per tonne of CO2 would only increase petrol costs by about 9 cents per gallon. This is dwarfed by moves in the market price of petrol. The vulnerability of the American economy to oil shocks argues for an increased tax on petrol, but that\'s a different policy debate. Mr Cowen seems to ignore the fact that oil is just one small part of the American economy\'s fossil-fuel use.\n\n> A carbon tax would attract rent-seeking, but arguably less than alternative policies, like subsidies or a cap-and-trade system. Importantly, money spent on adaptation or post hoc climate-disaster relief is also subject to rent-seeking and corruption issues. Given that many poor countries with weak institutions are likely to feel the brunt of the impact of global warming first and are likely to be poor spenders of the aid money that will invariably flow, a carbon tax looks like one of the policy solutions best suited to the minimisation of these ills.\n\n> Mr Cowen doesn\'t mention what I see as one of the most important roles of a carbon tax: as a check on other ill-advised programmes. A carbon tax would have quickly made the net dirtiness of corn-based ethanol obvious (by helping to offset subsidies and making\ncorn-based ethanol more expensive). It would be more difficult to roll out and sustain such misguided programmes with a carbon tax, and the ones that went ahead anyway would do less damage. A carbon tax is also the easiest way to capture whatever low-hanging emission- reduction fruit is out there.

Mill tailings often contain radium, thorium and trace amounts of uranium.**\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nArguing that the majority of waste from nuclear power plants isn't radioactive without mentioning what that waste is actually made up of is being disingenuous. Who cares if it's not radioactive if it's as toxic as lead and arsenic but lasts much longer?"", 'Civil and military nuclear enrichment plants can both do the exact same function. It just matters to what level you enrich your fissile material. \nhttps://thebulletin.org/2013/10/converting-a-civilian-enrichment-plant-into-a-nuclear-weapons-material-facility/#\n\nI agree that nuclear is important, but it does have some issues. In the US and India waste is a big problem, and most (nearly all) uranium mining takes place on native land, and comes with a host of health and environmental problems.', '> I will ask you your source for all of those.\n\nI have had this discussion many times. If I look up my sources and give them to you, you will just dismiss it with a handwave. That\'s just not worth my time. Think and read for yourself or don\'t, I don\'t really care.\n\n> no nunclear don\' t require big fossil plants to support it\n\nYeah, well... you cannot really scale down a nuclear plant\'s fuel usage, because it is a process we don\'t really control. So what do you do when demand goes down? Right, you either waste fuel by not using the power it spits out, or you have some other, more flexible power plant (which usually is a fossil plant these days) tone down, while the nuke goes on as if nothing changed. And guess what really happens in the wild.\n\nBut even if you don\'t take all this into account, just by the mere operating cost, a nuclear fission kWh is more expensive than one from solar and wind, even as you have to store solar and wind for obvious reasons.\n\n> civil nuclear and military nuclear are not at all the same level of \n> technology.\n\nIn order to supply the whole world with nuclear power, you would have to spread the knowledge to every corner of the planet. Naturally, that makes the step of enriching enough uranium to a sufficient purity for a bomb a lot easier to all countries.\n\nAnd yes, we need a solution that works for everything, for the whole planet\'s energy requirement. Nuclear power plants cannot do this on their own, it takes a lot longer to build than the model computations assume (which in turn drives cost upward tremendously, besides not being available to solve any problem we currently have).\n\nI wasn\'t talking about the whole cooling issue in the summer. That\'s another problem we haven\'t even talked about. I was talking about that the Fins claim to have found a site that will be geologically stable long enough to store nuclear waste there, which is IN PLAIN VIEW of the Baltic Sea. Climate change means sea level rise is already locked in to overwhelm that site. At best, the site will become unavailable rather soon, so the waste issue is no longer ""solved"" then. At worst, the waste will be liberated by corrosion with seawater, with all the fun that ensues.\n\n\nNow, in the case of Germany: All the nuclear power plants are (or were) OLD. Really old, thirty years and more, with cracks in the funniest places, and incidents that let you raise a few dozen eyebrows. So on top of the issues that nuclear power plants do have in principle, we have plants that might become a safety issue. In a densely populated country that is suffering more extreme weather events due to climate change, that is a recipe for disaster.', ""Interesting, i didnt thought our politics would be that bad, that not only its still in the coal and diesel car industry but also doesn't give enough effort to support renewables.

Such a neutron basically flies out of the space the reactions take place, they have so much kinetic energy.

This is the idea behind an atomic bomb, that with a big enough volume and density of radioactive matter you get so many slow flying neutrons that the rate at which decays happen is explosively quick. But more radioactive fuel is not the only way to increase the rate of decays, surrounding the fuel with another material can also slow down enough neutrons, increasing the rate of decay (and energy output), without this exponential nature (since a moderator material won\'t become unstable if it accepts a neuron), allowing us to control this insane energy-containing process (even finely, since more moderator -> more slow neurons until there is basically no more neuron) Depending on reactor architecture, this moderator can be graphite, water (D2O heavy water, or normal), etc.', 'one thing is certain, I won\'t change my opinion based on trash comments like yours that Cité nothing only to lecture me on something I supposedly don\'t know\n\nespecially ones that say stuff like ""nuclear need fossile fuel"" to work, when we obviously don\'t here in France.\n\nyou are the equivalent of a you tube comment troll, telling me to ""do my own research"" on why the earth is flat', 'lmao dude nuclear reactors run on uran235 which wil last for 200 years max if we decide that noone is allowed to build a new plant from now on. so forget that. \n\nbut sure go on with your weird flex but i would make sure that they fire your professor.', ""you need 10 years to build a reactor alone. i fucking love how you try to defend your standpoint at any cost but completely ignore my arguments because you know you can't beat them. but sure.. let's build reactors we can't use in 50 years.. great use of money and ressources."", ""You're acting as though I was arguing for more coal instead of nuclear.
