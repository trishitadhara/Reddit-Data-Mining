1,The Amazon is burning and you're not Brazilian. Here's what you can do.,"I'll preface this by saying that, being Brazilian, I do understand your anger at my government's gross encouragement of ecocide and indigenous genocide. It is the same anger I and millions of other Brazilians feel every day, as much about what's being done with the rainforest as about what's being done with our lives: Bolsonaro has deregulated masses of agrotoxins and pesticides, effectively legalized a 7-day work-week, passed a pension reform that generally ensures we'll work until we die, presides over a massive police brutality spike in Rio de Janeiro and other cities, and is trying to close or privatize the public universities where millions of poor people study for free. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief on the web, Brazilians aren't benefitting from the Amazon being stripped off the earth (EDIT: and [a recent nationwide poll](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-49411984) shows that 96% are against deforesting and in favour of stronger regulation, and 89% want Congress to work towards zero deforesting). The only ones who benefit are the big landowners and land-grabbers who use the cleared ground for cattle ranching and soy plantations. These people have close to zero oversight on their earnings, holdings, and crimes. Brazil has never had a land reform; an almost colonial regime still holds in the countryside, and new forms of colonialism cast a shadow over our cities and politics. 

From 2003 to 2016, the country was governed by the centre-left Workers' Party - which, while disappointingly uncommitted to indigenous and rural causes, did see a reduction of deforestation rates from 28 000 km^2 a year in 2004 to 4 500 km^2 a year in 2012. It was removed in a soft coup, supported by the US and met with silence by the EU. The coup government, supported by the aforementioned landowners, ramped deforestation rates up to the 7 000 km^2 a year ballpark - as well as making life worse for everyone, leaving office with less than 5% approval. In last year's election, Lula, who was President from 2003 to 2010, was set to win a landslide over Bolsonaro - until an anti-corruption operation called Car Wash, [recently proven to be politically motivated](https://theintercept.com/2019/06/09/brazil-car-wash-prosecutors-workers-party-lula/), arrested him on dubious charges and did its best to isolate him from the electoral field. Once again, there are hints of US involvement, starting with the training of the judge responsible and coming to a foreign-funded fake news machine. Bolsonaro might apparently preside over a near 100% increase in deforestation rates, but his approval rates have quickly decayed. It is becoming increasingly obvious to the general population that he is leading us into one of the darkest periods of our history. It might be literally so, as smoke from the recent fires has even darkened São Paulo's afternoon skies.

This is all to say that the proposed solutions of assassinating Bolsonaro, as a conspiracy theorist tried to do on the campaign trail, or going to war against Brazil, as advocated by [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/05/who-will-invade-brazil-to-save-the-amazon/), will only bring more strife into an already suffering country, and do nothing to halt the demise of the Amazon. But there are forms of international action that can.

**1) Sanction Brazilian beef, soy, and all activities of big landowners. Pressure for immediate land reform, as laid down in the 1988 Constitution.**

**2) Launch an international investigation and take to task those who have aided and abetted in the 2016 coup and in Lula's political prison.** That would likely include several current and former American government officials and judges, as well as oil executives and bankers.

**3) Show solidarity with Brazilian activists. Protest at embassies and foreign branches of BNDES. Take down your own fascist government.** Though there tends to be an international media blackout on Brazilian news that aren't related to the Amazon, we do see and listen to what is happening worldwide. Occupy a Brazilian embassy with a thousand people and we will take a million to the streets again. Topple one of the many fascists of today and we will be sure to adopt your tactics.","['More than [90 percent of the Amazon rain forest that’s been cleared since 1970](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/15060/277150PAPER0wbwp0no1022.pdf?sequence=1) is used for meat production (raising animals and growing food to eat them).\n\n**4.

The Amazon is also cleared for soy to ship abroad to China and Europe to feed animals. In Canada, we're still chopping down forest to increase pasture land and land to grow crops feed cows.

Even cows started grass fed burp methane and almost all end up on feed lots at the end of their life (eating crops grown on land cleared to feed them). Finally, purchasing animal products leads to increased demand and the system responds to that. Your demand for local meat/milk might contribute to higher prices and less affluent individuals purchasing less 'responsible' products cheaper elsewhere. \n\nThe caloric and protein conversion of plants through animals is really low.

You\'re not, thank you for asking this question. Unfortunately climate change means a lot of change, and change is hard, and local meat doesn\'t change a lot of issues. It is certainly better, but it would still need to paired down to *everyone eating much less meat* in order for demand not to ruin all pros of local. \n\n\n\nThe cattle industry in the US is just as shit as Brazil, unfortunately in Brazil they are striking at a world heritage site and a hugely important resource in carbon sequestration.\n\n\n\nSince the 1900s, the only industry keeping conservation biology from reintroducing keystone species in America is cattle ranchers. Without those keystone species, habitat restoration is never fully realized. Any claims by cattle industry to be helping wildlife is all purely select wildlife that just so happens to benefit from maximizing their own profits: some grassland birds, and other large grazing animals. That\'s more than most landscape development helps, true, but remember they actively block legislation to reintroduce other species into parks and preserves that may threaten cattle. That\'s not net neutrality, that\'s a net loss: we dont need more deer we need more wolves and bears.\n\n\nCattle ranching has also counted among its ranks some of the worst figure heads of the modern American alt-right. Literal ""martyrs"" tea party ethics like the Bundy family. While theres certainly room for criticism on how the federal government handled standoffs with cattle ranchers, there\'s little room to doubt those ranchers have played an enormous role in the fear that fuels modern debates of gun control and white supremacy. \n\n\nWhich, in a way, is hugely ironic given that 152 million acres and millions of dollars annually are given to cattle ranchers a year, subsidized by the federal government aka you the tax payer. Cattle ranching would have gone the way of fur trapping in the 21st century were it not for government subsidies. They enjoy many of the pieces of legislation out of the Great Depression that started with good intentions but have not been rightfully challenged in over 100 years. So even by the standards of believing in the free market; cattle ranching is undeservedly propped up with money. \n\n\nOutside of the many implicitly biological issues that cows themselves cause and contribute to climate change, a diet heavy in red meat makes (by our own governments admission and estimates) a person on an exponential scale more unhealthy. Three times more likely to have heart disease (number one killer of Americans), and ten times more likely to be overweight. Dairy has no place in a balanced diet, really. Mammals are not meant to be drinking milk past infancy, and theres so many much better substitutes that dont wreck your gut biome. \n\n\nSo the cost of cattle ranching in the US: increased chronic disease and fatal conditions, increased taxes for subsidizes, more lobbies against conservation biology that has lead to ecological nightmares like our current deer population, a bastion of political idealists who think government should literally not exist and celebrate the idea of amassing guns and taking the law into their own (wealthy, evangelical, white, prevailingly patriarchal) hands, contributing to climate change, contrinuting to antibiotic resistance, and of course just contributing to inhumane quality of life for v cute social animals who sole reason to live is to die for consumption of what is, imo, underwhelming food products like fast food hamburgers.\n\n\nI can give sources if youd like, but cattle ranching has *always* been pretty evil way before lighting the rainforest on fire and really on par with the level of political ruthlessness and apathy toward human rights as we are seeing with the Amazon on fire.

They are if you  look at the cumulative emissions in the period 1988 - 2015.

The remaining 90  % is downstream emissions. So if Shell or BP drills up oil and someone  uses the oil in their car the emissions will be attributed to Shell, and  not the driver.\n\nIs this 71 % of  ALL anthropogenic emissions? No, this excludes non-industrial sources,  mainly land-use, agriculture and forestry. I don\'t know exactly how this  is accounted, but this excludes about 25 % of GHG emissions. So the  gain from veganism is not in this number. So the real number might be  about 54 % of anthropogenic emissions, but again I don’t know how this  would be accounted.

5,Go Greta Go!,,"[""Things you can do that actually have an impact on your personal footprint:\n\n1. Vote for candidates with aggressive and positive environmental policies as a priority.\n2. Reduce/cut out meat and dairy. Beef and cheese, especially, have an unbelievably high carbon footprint. Try to replace dairy milk with hazelnut, oat, almond, soy etc. Just as cheap and (in my opinion) just as nice.\n3. Pay for a green tariff. Especially ones that promise 100% renewable energy supply - personally I do not include Nuclear and Biomass as true renewable, but that's up to you.\n4. Reduce your travel; especially plane travel. Use public transport or walk/cycle wherever possible.\n5. If you can afford it, install retro-fit insulation, solar panels, solar-thermal panels (cheaper and will give you free hot water for showers etc), or micro-wind systems. The pay-back time on these, if you have the upfront cash, is pretty decent.\n6. Ask the company you work for why their building isn't powered by renewables or on a renewable tariff. Talk to coworkers, get them involved in the discussion. Most offices would benefit from renewables. I know that there are companies in Europe (Statkraft etc) and probably America that offer free installation of solar panels on your building, and then supply electricity to you at a greatly reduced rate. Great if you don't have the upfront cash.\n7. An extension of 6. ASK QUESTIONS, TALK ABOUT IT. Tell people you care about it, tell people what you're doing. Get involved.\n8. Plant trees and wildflowers in your garden instead of lawn (which is uglier than flowers in my opinion, and has no biodiversity). Every new tree absorbs about 13 pounds (6 kilo) of CO2 a year.\n9. Make investments into sustainable/low impact causes, rather than companies than invest in Oil & Gas.\n\nI know, no matter what you do as an individual, it's difficult to ignore that most emissions are from industrial companies well out of your control. But all is not lost. Consumer change on a large scale, especially in terms of demanding renewable energy supply and GREATLY reduced meat and dairy industry consumption, WILL CHANGE THE WORLD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: These are all important and in no particular order.

Growing a tree and letting it hit 15 years before cutting it is what you do for large lumber (which you cannot get from hemp). But if you want to maximize paper production, and also carbon sequestration, you can instead run coppice systems where vigorous trees are kept in the vegetative state indefinitely by harvesting them to the ground at 4 years of age. \n\nWhen they are cut like this, they regrow fast, and are re-cut 4 years later to the ground.

The faster it grows, the more carbon it sucks out of the air. However, the carbon is only one part of photosynthesis. As the plant uses the energy of photosynthesis and the water/carbon, it produces sugars. It then uses the energy and *some* of the sugars, combined with nutrient dredged up by the root in order to produce those leaves and seeds. \n\nHemp is a very heavy bioaccumulator of Nitrogen, Zinc, Iron, Phosphate, magnesium and potassium. A giant hemp farm will completely devastate the soil and it's nutrients. It can only be kept in full production indefinitely by indefinitely bringing those nutrients back in via fertilizers.

Instead, use hemp as PART of a rich polyculture crop. Some elements in the polyculture crop are nitrogen fixing legume plants such as clover, or vetch. Some elements are deep taprooted pioneer plants such as comfrey or mullein.\n\nBecause if you just ran hemp in a field for 10 years and used it as a massive carbon sink (and didn't want to fertilize, due to the carbon footprint associated with it (among other issues such as toxic runoff into waterways)), then what you would end up doing is depleting soils and eventually dead, cracked, scorched earth.\n\nGrowing plants is more about growing soils. Growing soils as your priority is important. The plants come as a consequence of healthy soils. You can ONLY grow soils if you grow in a polyculture, and you return some of that nutrient to feed the soil life. You cannot simply have a monoculture of hemp and extract extract extract. It looks great on the CO2 removal aspect, but it creates a whole host of other, equally existential threat-level problems.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nHemp is awesome and should be used.

You can ONLY grow soils if you grow in a polyculture, and you return some of that nutrient to feed the soil life. You cannot simply have a monoculture of hemp and extract extract extract. It looks great on the CO2 removal aspect, but it creates a whole host of other, equally existential threat-level problems.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nHemp is awesome and should be used. But it is not objectively better than tree systems. It IS objectively better if you only consider CO2 sequestration, but it mines and depletes soils - whereas tree based systems can actually regenerate soils.

Better explained than what I was going to respond with. \n\nAlso one more point, which is that, unfortunately, if we didn’t use our forests for timber harvests, they would likely be cut down so the land could be made profitable in some other way. Like for a subdivision, or cattle ranching, or what have you. In an ideal world replacing tree products with hemp would mean saving forests, but we don’t live in that world (yet?). \n\nMy local forests (PNW) are heavily managed and on 100 year rotation schedules. Most are owned by green diamond and the forest service, and both use current best practices for timber management. Of course laws and practices change all the time, but they are unlikely to go back to clear cutting since it is less profitable to have an unhealthy ecosystem and to have to replant more trees manually. The current system ensures that the oldest trees reseed into smaller cut areas to naturally reproduce more large trees with similar genetics. Of course they do reseed manually as well, typically by helicopter.\n\nThey have already harvested pretty much every natural Doug Fir at least four times over back when clear cutting and burning all the slash was the norm, and have replanted with genetically identical clones of perfectly straight Doug Fir that have even and widely spaced branches (i.e. knots), so that all new trees should be similar if not identical, which maximizes usable wood from every tree harvested. So there is very little genetic diversity to begin with in our forests anymore. They are more like heavily managed farmlands, farming trees rather than animals, than a natural forest.

We can find innovation in this plant. Also there was thousands of acres of wild hemp in human lifetime. It’s gone! We can’t possibly plant enough trees to do the work hemp could “And we need to replace those trees as well”. Just at the moment we don’t have the time to Solely depend on trees we need to be doing both.  Plant a tree and drop a weed!!! We could plant them in highway on ramps or in between separation lanes.', 'So yeah, it depends on what the hemp is being used for. If it\'s just being used as a chop and drop soil builder, then roughly 10% of it is stored in a relatively permanent way. That\'s very complex, and it basically comes down to an explosion of soil food web microorganisms, who constantly live and die, sequester and release, but the GROWTH of the population of them over time (in healthy soils) means that at any time, if the life in the soil is growing in population, so is ""stored"" carbon. It WILL all get released eventually, but when you look at snapshots in time, the amount stored is proportional to the populations at the time of the snapshot.\n\nThe problem is, you can never find someone who understands this stuff - and most people who talk about it don\'t actually even know what they are talking about. For example, it\'s super frustrating when people say ""yeah but, hur, dur, all that carbon gets released when the living stuff dies"". Well yeah, it does, eventually, but until they die, it is stored. And if their life causes more life which then stores more carbon, then the net amount stored at any point is going up. Sure it all gets released, but when it does, more is being stored, due to the exponential growth of more life.\n\nSame deal with trees. People say that it doesn\'t matter because when you chop a tree down it will eventually re-release all that carbon back. Well yeah, it will, but how long will it take? Woodchips? Maybe 3 years. Furniture? Maybe 200 to 500 years. Biochar? Literally 2000 years. And in that time, the tree was harvested, light was released, and more stuff grew.\n\nAll we can do is basically maximize photosynthesis. That\'s the game. And we do that by maximizing the 3d area that has green stuff on it. And that\'s why ANY proposal which entails a monoculture is an abject failure. Because I can take any system and create a monoculture with it, and I basically create a 2-d plane of green. However, mix it with tall and short stuff, overstory trees, understory trees, bushes, herbs, groundcover, and root crops, with vines growing up it all, that system has absolutely ridiculous photosynthesis surface area per unit volume.\n\nSure, hemp may grow really fast and sequester a lot of carbon, but it\'s like a quick charging but very small battery. An oak tree is like a slow charging but MASSIVE battery. \n\nIf we are going to micromanage the hemp, then we can store a crapload of ""energy"" (carbon) quickly, but it takes a TON of management, and soils simply cannot handle that much extraction. However, if we use hemp as the groundcover/herbaceous layer in a forest ecosystem, then we not only get the tremendous carbon sequestration of the hemp, we also get the giant battery of the oak. We also get the acorns from the oak, which feeds the squirrels, who store carbon in THEIR bodies. The squirrels when they die will release the carbon as they decompose, but will cause an explosion in soil microbiome as they feed one the rich squirrel nutrients, storing food in THEIR body. \n\nAll the microbiology that is fed from the increased LIFE in the system is NEVER accounted for. A forest ecosystem has a tremendous amount more life in it than a hemp field. Bugs, birds, snakes, frogs, worms, pill bugs, bacteria, nematodes, arthropods, protozoa, mycelium, etc. \n\nAnd while all that stuff DOES release carbon back when it eventually dies, what matters is that while it\'s alive, the LIFE in the system is constantly exploding and expanding. So at any given time, even though all the carbon locked in the bodies of life will eventually get re-released, the important thing is that the populations are exploding and expanding. So any SNAPSHOT in time has more carbon stored in life than the previous.\n\nNone of the ""hemp captures X amount of carbon compared to an oak tree"" captures ANY of these complex dynamics of life. And these complex dynamics dwarf the shit out of the impact of one plant/tree. \n\nIf we want to sequester the most amount of carbon, then what we REALLY want to do is to plant ECOSYESTEMS which regenerate and replicate, and explode exponentially with living organisms inside them. Yes, even carbon exhaling organisms. Because life begets life, and all life is made of carbon, storing it in their bodies. Not just the trees, but all the life that the tree is responsible for, via it\'s nuts, it\'s fruit, it\'s plant-root-exudates that feed bacteriophages, etc.', 'honestly, I have some reservations about a lot of the permaculture crowd, mainly that a few of the big names in it are pretty much just low-level entrepreneurial swindlers trying to sell good ideas they’ve ripped off from others - and that gets into some other issues of neocolonialism and how much homesteading is ick.

If such a thing were to happen, 4C would be the least of our worries.  Arctic permafrost, a “sleeping giant” of greenhouse gases, is melting faster than expected and could release 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide.  As the ground warms, the microbes in the soil wake up and start belching greenhouse gases. Estimates vary, but the report says 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide lurk beneath the Earth’s permafrost.

In all due respect, how do you justify shooting students protesting a bullshit political war?', 'My biggest point on becoming vegan for environmental reasons is to cut out the middleman. What I mean by that is there is no reason to eat animals when we can eat plants instead. In 1997, a [Cornell ecologist](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) found that with the grain that only the U.S. grew, we would have been able to feed 800 million people. And that was 20 years ago. Basically, by cutting out the animals eating plants and having humans eat the plants directly, we would save so many resources from being wasted, as well as lessen the impact on our soil being eroded and our air being polluted. The yield of protein we get from animals makes no sense when you look at the resources going into it.\n\nEating vegan is one of the easiest choices to make and follow through with when it comes to your personal footprint. It also might be [the single biggest way](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html%3famp) to reduce your carbon footprint (by up to 73%). Not everyone has access to public transportation or can bike to work while the vast majority of people in developed countries have access to eat a healthy, filling vegan diet. I understand that our personal footprint alone isn’t what is even close to ruining the environment. However, I believe that by following a vegan diet, you are a part of a larger (and ever growing) group that will have a positive impact on the environment. Governments and cooperations a lot of times are one step behind society. Why not show them through our little power we have in capitalism that we don’t want dairy farming to be subsidized and we don’t want slaughterhouses to be subsidized? Once these bigger changes are made that’s when the bigger impacts will start coming. Without a demand for outdated agricultural practices, then there will be no supply. With no supply, there won’t be [cows hurting our environment.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/business/energy-environment/how-growth-in-dairy-is-affecting-the-environment.html) \n\nOf course, there are so many other industries that are awful for the environment. It seems like almost everything we do nowadays is bad for the environment when you actually look into it. My stance on veganism is that you can be a vegan while still doing so many other things like second hand shopping, boycotting planes & cruises, growing your own food & buying in bulk, avoiding plastic & palm oil, buying in season and locally, lowering your internet usage, protesting & writing into your government officials, joining CCL, etc etc. Why not show your support for more environmentally friendly farming practices AND do everything else you’re already doing?

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.\n\n“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”\n\nThe scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.\n“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”\nThe signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.\n\n“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”\n“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,” they state.\nIn particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as “unfit for their purpose.”\n“Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,” they propose. “Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.”\n“We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,” they declare.', '[deleted]', 'You can’t fathom the money, time, and resources dedicated to convincing the populous that the climate emergency is fake, and oil & gas are still viable sources of energy!!! \nThey are terrified at the idea that everyone (especially youth) will “wake up” and say “enough of this bull shit.

If you don’t make it to the end, I would be very grateful for any answer you could provide by way of reply.\n\nANSWERS I HAVE FOUND THAT ARE “CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR”\n\nFrom my own searching, Climate Change Lobby comes closest in the United States, followed by Environmental Voter Project (and I would like learn more about Nathaniel Stinnet’s algorithm).  In Canada, Leadnow comes the closest.  However, each of their websites state that they are non-partisan.  The climate change activists I seek would be willing to become partisan, however briefly, within a party for specific climate change purposes.\n\nWHY MY QUESTION IS INTERESTING\n\nWe (and probably many others) agree that a few of the biggest and best solutions are to price carbon, encourage renewable energy, stop fossil fuel subsidies, phase out fossil fuel, and encourage development of new energy and transport technology.\n\nWe probably further agree that the most effective action an individual can take is political action that makes elected politicians do those things.\n\nWe further agree that 90% of seats are not competitive in the general election (at least in the USA) and that climate policy has a better shot at passing if Republicans introduce it.\n\nWe agree that some of the best political activities are to: (1) Vote; (2) Lobby; (3) Recruit; and (4) Fix the System.\n\nHowever, I am very interested in effectiveness and efficiency.  I am very interested in thinking more about a new first-priority political activity:  Join a political party and vote at two crucial times:  When the party elects a leader and when the party elects an election candidate.  More effectively:  join a climate change group working to get more people to do this.\n\nI have little confidence in in my knowledge of the American system.  Maybe the American version of the climate change group I am trying to find organizes climate change activists to identify and vote for specific individuals in the primaries of both parties (or maybe there are two separate organizations).   (Go back to the part about 90% of seats not being competitive in the general election and that climate policy has a better shot at passing if Republicans introduce it).\n\nI have more confidence in my knowledge of the Canadian system.  This is not the place to debate NDPers, so I hope, for the sake of the conversation, that we can accept that, like it or not, either the Liberal leader or the Conservative leader is going to become the next Prime Minister.  I hope it is beyond debate that the Prime Minster and the Prime Minister’s Office do pretty much whatever they want and that an individual MP has very little power to actually implement any climate change solution.  Ditto for provinces, premiers, and members of the provincial legislatures.\n\nThus, the individual citizen’s political power to make politicians do what he or she wants is wickedly distilled and can be exercised with very little time, often online, and sometimes with no money (conditions vary) at the time when the parties that will probably win select their leaders.  (The deadline for joining the Ontario liberals to do it in their present party leadership campaign was 2 December 2019.  The deadline for joining the Canadian Conservatives to do it in their present leadership campaign is some date I don’t presently know within the next few months).\n\nThus my interest in seeking groups or individuals who are working on this.\n\nBONUS QUESTION:\n\nWhere (and how) might I post a more elaborate version of these thoughts for discussion and debate?\n\nI really do not want to debate here anything below my third sentence, which is the sentence after my first question mark (but my son, who helped me get started with reddit earlier this week, has explained that I cannot control that).\n\nI REALLY HOPE FOR ANSWERS to my question.\n\nI also really would like to discuss this idea more generally, but I would like to elucidate it better and put it into its own “thing”.  \n\nI do not know how to do that.  Maybe if Snarky Hedge Hog sees this, he or she could help me with a separate reply about doing this within this reddit, even if it to state where else on reddit I can find information.  I just noticed the “How it All Works” thing that was sent to me when I signed up to reddit and I will look at that soon\n\n\nThank you for considering these matters.

Climate alarmists argue this will be\nthe case if policymakers do not adopt\ndraconian measures to eliminate fossil\nfuels, especially coal, which produce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that, they allege, cause harmful global warming.\rAlarmists have difficulty making this argument because, despite increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, global temperatures have risen very little during the past two decades, and sea-level trends are not significantly different from what they were seven to nine decades ago, when CO2 levels were 310 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less.1 Dire predictions made decades ago of dramatically accelerating polar ice loss, and an ice-free Arctic Ocean have not come to pass.2 As Dr. Steven E. Koonin, former Undersecretary for Science for the Obama administration, noted in 2014, “Even though the human influence on climate was much smaller in the past, the models do not account for the fact that the rate of global sea-level rise 70 years ago was as large as what we observe today.”3\r* Dennis E.

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.\n\n“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”\n\nThe scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.\n“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”\nThe signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.\n\n“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”\n“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,” they state.\nIn particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as “unfit for their purpose.”\n“Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,” they propose. “Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.”\n“We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,” they declare.', 'My first time on this sub and this is one of the first commets.

Exceptional climate stability characterizes the centuries of the Ro- man Empire’s rise; certain regions enjoyed unusually favorable conditions. In the western Roman Empire, the arst century b.c. through the arst and possibly second century a.d. were warmer than later centuries. Archaeological evidence from Britain, ice- core data from Greenland, and dendrodata about summer temperatures \n\n\nfrom Austria all agree on this score, as does the fact that the Alpine glaciers were retreating and, in the arst and second cen- tury a.d., relatively small, comparable probably to their extent c. 2000 a.d. Two potential climate-forcing factors both show un- usual stability. Within the generally even level of solar activity be- tween c. 200 b.c. and 600 a.d., the centuries from 200 b.c. to 100 a.d. stand out as particularly stable (Figure 1a). An exception- ally low level of volcanic activity also prevailed from c. 40 b.c. to 150 a.d. (Figure 2b). In central Greenland, temperatures became warm from c. 20 b.c. to c. 75 a.d. A stable, relatively cool period followed from c. 100 to c. 270 a.d. (Figure 2c). The speleothem in Austria’s Spannagel Cave indicates stable conditions until about 250 a.d. (Figure 1b). Written sources from about 75 b.c. to c. 175 a.d. emphasize moisture (Figure 6a), predominantly in the form of the oooding of the Tiber River recorded at Rome. Pre- cipitation in northeastern France was stable and largely balanced, ouctuating within narrow margins, also until about 250 a.d. (Fig- ure 5b). Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions deduced from pollen deposits in the Eifel maars (lakes formed from extinct vol- canoes) also point to a stable climate pattern overall (Figures 3 and 4).6\nIn detail, the chloride (Cl-) levels from Greenland indicate that sea ice retreated, implying that warming occurred between about 15 b.c. and 40 a.d. Cooling resumed with sea-ice expan- sion, peaking c. 70 a.d. before renewed warming in the last years of the arst century (Figure 2a). The Greenland ice cores signal slow, slight cooling starting in the second century a.d. and contin- uing to about 270, implying longer winters in the North Atlantic (Figure 2c; cf. Figure 11). The Austrian alpine dendrodata indi- cate that the warm summer temperatures c. 85 b.c. cooled until c. 35 b.c., followed by general warming interrupted by some cool years c. 20 a.d. and again between about 75 and 93, perhaps re- lated to the Vesuvian eruption that destroyed Pompeii in 79 a.d. (Figure 5a). Nevertheless, the Alpine glaciers experienced a long retreat, and warm temperatures dominated in the Austrian Alps through the second century, punctuated by further cool spells\n\n\n\nhttp://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/glodech/PDFs/McCormickEtAl2013.pdf\n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-m&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=17193494741720757222.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-m&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=17193494741720757222\n\nWhat many alarmists forget is that 96% of CO2 is naturally produced!!\n\nLess than 4% is anthropogenic !\n\nNo evidence that the 96% has always been and will remain static !\n\nBut they say the 4% tail is wagging the 96% dog !\n\nFurthermore the total percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is 0.03% !!!\n\nFinally they totally ignore the mediaeval warming period ...climates have always changed and will continue.', 'Why don’t you try and disprove the talking points instead of just being so dismissive and puerile which is typical of the eco-freak response. \n\nAs for a copy and paste nobody has time to type everything again it’s known as IT. \n\nIt’s not my bullshit it’s been documented by hundreds of climate scientists who of course just gets shouted down by people like you.

While you can be technically right in saying the economic growth and reduction in demand on the environment aren't in opposition, I think the current crisis we're in has been rooted in a fundamental prioritization of the current *capitalist* economy where growth and profit are put before the environment.\n\nThe issue being that there are many instances where even supposedly green consumption and production end up not being so in the long run by the mere fact that the environment is variable and there is no perfect equilibrium that remains. If you produce even an ostensibly green product, it may not be so green when its high demand, consumption, production, storage, transportation, and/or disposal begin to take a toll on the local or even global environment. Then another environmental problem arises and again we wont address it in the time frame we need to to mitigate damage because it is very profitable.\n\n I mean, that's really why we're in the climate crisis at the moment, its not even because going green wouldn't be economically sustainable but because that the people who have allocated so much wealth and power essentially change what is valued in the economy and what it currently values is the short term profits of the fossil fuel tycoons. And our economic system does not give any actual way for us to combat people like this who take advantage of the extreme amount of power that the system allows them to accrue. \n\nOr, vice versa, the current recycling crisis--for example--is due in part to the fact that recycling ultimately is not very profitable. I'm sure some innovation could possibly help but what I'm getting at is that the fundamental problem is that our economy does not value things we actually/should value, rather its primarily gauging the wealth and prosperity of very very few people. You cannot have the necessary adaptations to environmental changes (at least in the appropriate time to address them, i.e. the current climate crisis)  when it has to first be deemed beneficial to the economy which ultimately only valuing things that are very irrelevant to most people.\n\nI probably didn't communicate this well but I think you get the gist."", ""Yet conventional thought is that a 3% annual growth rate in the world economy is desirable! That is a doubling time of about 24 years. That means taking all the damage global civilization is doing, which is already pushing us to the precipice of destruction, and doubling it! Then doubling it again! It's sheer madness.\n\n And all our efficiency gains have simply served to increase the marginal value of resource extraction, leading to cumulatively increasing damage to the climate and natural communities of the world. For all the renewable energy the world has installed, fossil fuel use has not declined at all - the renewable energy has merely been tacked on top of increasing fossil fuels- and indeed, fossil fuels represents nearly the exact same ratio -80%- of total global energy they did thirty years ago.\n\nOn the contrary, economic growth is absolutely the issue. [Here is what it would take for the industrialized world to conform to the very lax standard of limiting global heating to 2C with just even odds, using conservative assumptions of the Earth's equilibrium carbon sensitivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDCQkrRJmA&t=1s). That's annual reductions in carbon emissions of upwards of **15% across the industrialized world**, and average decarbonization rate of 5% a year, globally, starting today, and continuing every year until full decarbonization of the total energy system (not just electricity). To think that this is somehow compatible with economic growth is delusional. It's not even possible by building low carbon energy supply alone- its only possible  with deep reductions in energy demand. Yet virtually no economists recognize this fundamental physical reality.\n\nThere's also a deep conceptual problem with the conventional economic thinking of how you can appropriately account for externalities.

The only way to achieve such substantial degrowth that might salvage a livable climate in the medium term while also ensuting a dignified existance for the 8B people on this rock is to recapture all the trillions of dollars of wealth accumulated and hoarded by the elite class.  These people are ALL in their privleged positions because of capitalism.\n\nWhen have the wealthy ever voluntarily surrendered their wealth to help their fellow humans?  They never do.  Even so-called philanthropy and charity by the wealthy is virtually always connected to some benefit for themselves one way or another.  Billionaires only exist because those people have a pathological drive to hoard money.  I don\'t believe that can just go away by virtue of the wealthy ""seeing the light"" and giving away all their wealth to help others in this time of need.  It needs to he taken from them, which will never happen under a capitalist society because under capitalism the wealthy control everything.', ""I'm with you on this, my current view:\n\n- economic growth comes at a cost to the environment  \n- this cost arises as energy and matter are converted to waste - consumed - by the economy  \n- therefore, measures of economic growth are actually measures of consumption  \n- the higher GDP goes, the faster the Earth is being consumed  \n- GDP is not a measure of growth, it's a measure of the speed at which we are approaching death  \n- there is no way to avoid this death - only slow it down  \n- capitalism is geared to maximize consumption - to raise GDP - and thus shorten the lifespan of the Earth  \n- to maximize the lifespan of the Earth, consumption must be minimized\n- in other words, ideally, in an Earth-first world, GDP should be zero, or even negative (if that's possible)"", ""Economic growth is just describing that our global economy is growing. If that economy is completely clean, carbon neutral and using sustainable resource consumption, it doesn't matter. You can argue that that's not true in reality, but I'm not saying it is.\n\nMy point is that fixating on growth is looking at the issue backwards. Growth can deliver incredible humanitarian benefits, and we should pursue it in a way which is progressively distributed, sustainable, and most importantly, doesn't come with the anxiety society that capitalism has created. You are completely correct to say that to continue growing in this way is like pouring gasoline on the fire - but that is only because the situation is so bad to begin with, and that future growth will be just as shit.\n\n>For all the renewable energy the world has installed, fossil fuel use has not declined at all - the renewable energy has merely been tacked on top of increasing fossil fuels- and indeed, fossil fuels represents nearly the exact same ratio -80%- of total global energy they did thirty years ago.\n\nYes, this is a really important point - but as I say, that's because there are still no negative externality taxes applied to fossil fuels. They're still being subsidised across the world. This is just bad economics, I would scold my A-level students for failing to acknowledge this.\n\n>There's also a deep conceptual problem with the conventional economic thinking of how you can appropriately account for externalities....\n\nI agree, but again, your conclusion to this:\n\n>The responsible approach is to throw out a marginal cost-benefit framing and adopt an extreme precautionary framing- because the existential risk posed by the crisis must be minimized, regardless of cost...\n\nIs just good economics thinking. Utility maximisation across two choices - where one involves the extinction of the human race - is not a particularly difficult challenge. In defence of Nordhaus, I'd suggest that any pricing is better than none - which is the way our planet currently operates.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nI go to the supermarket, I can choose between a vegan sandwich, and one containing meat. There is no disincentive - financial or otherwise, which pushes me towards the climate friendly option. Almost all of our purchasing decisions feature no endogenous function of their climate footprint. Any A-level student can point this out.\n\nEconomists have a habit of trampling into other disciplines, attempting to connect them to economics, sometimes in clumsy ways, others in ingenious ways. I don't think that that is a fault of economists, it's just a consequence of single-disciplinary training.\n\nGoing further, I've been very lucky to study a degree in one subject (economics), and a masters in another (humanitarian engineering). Going between the two subjects, I've been very lucky to notice just how insular single-disciplined people can be. For example, my thesis concerns the economic viability of self-consumption photovoltaic panels in a developing country. During my time combing the literature, I've seen engineers and climate professors who 'fudge' their assumptions into neat, concise numbers, because they don't see the importance from an economic perspective. Changing for example, a degradation rate of a panel from 0.7% to 0.5% may not seem like a massive issue, but over the lifetime, and with enough of these changes, answers can be very different.\n\nThe point of this is to say, not that economists are superior to engineers, but rather that, every single discipline is important and has a role to play. To be honest, if you told me that a group of only economists came up with a solution to such an important issue as climate externality pricing, I'd bet everything I owned that it wouldn't be 100% correct. Firstly, all academics make mistakes, that doesn't mean that all the conventional wisdom in their discipline is wrong, and that we should no longer listen to economists because one dude fucked up his approach to a really difficult problem. And second, if you gave the same tasks to scientists, they'd probably fuck it up as well.\n\nSomething which threatens and is entangled in, every single aspect of human life, cannot be dealt with by one discipline. You need every discipline to pitch in and contribute to a solution.\n\nDemonising and pointing at economists - as if we are all bloodthirsty freshwater economists (I couldn't help myself), does nothing. Are some economists contributing in ways which are damaging to the planet? Yes. But the what-about-ism's are easy in that sense: what about the countless scientists and engineers who have worked for climate destroying companies? Do they get a free ride? Or do we start to realise that targeting disciplines is a childish thing that you are supposed to grow out of by your second week at university?"", 'Yeah, but how to convince those countries if the rich world succeeds in reduce by 45%, but there is no perceptible result?']"

What isn’t mentioned is that it isn’t just a judge in the US that determined this was malpractice, it’s pretty much every court in the world that has looked into the case.

The damage inflicted by Texaco occurred more than a decade earlier. \n\nOf course, no mention is ever made of made of the damage caused by Ecuador’s state oil company after Texaco left. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, the lawsuit was never really about justice for Ecuadoreans harmed by Texaco. It seems to me that it was about Ecuador scapegoating Chevron for the harm caused the actions it took along with Texaco. \n\nThe thing about this that unnerves me is how little critical thinking happens when the target is an oil company.

And it discusses the probable impact on sea level rise, albeit conservatively, given how dramatic it has obviously been. So, there are regular articles that appear — it’s not that global warming is ignored.

They do a long article, maybe 1,000 words — I have one particular example in mind — it will mention environmental consequences, it may harm the local water resources for ranchers, but literally not a word on the effect on global warming. And that happens in article after article in every outlet — the Financial Times, the New York Times, all the major newspapers.

Airplanes emit particles and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, lead, and black carbon which interact among themselves and with the atmosphere.Despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines, the rapid growth of air travel in the past years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation. From 1992 to 2005, passenger kilometers increased 5.2 percent per year. In the European Union, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87 percent between 1990 and 2006.Comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes, engines, aerodynamics and flight operations, there is no end in sight, even many decades out, to rapid growth in CO2 emissions from air travel and air freight, due to projected continual growth in air travel.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28', 'I fully support fighting for systemic change with our own individual actions. \n\n* I\'ve talked with friends and family about a [carbon tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price).

While the fuel is produced by large companies, the residual actor responsible for the emissions is the end consumer.  \nEvidently, “stopping” these 100 companies would just be forbidding the production of fossil fuel. Ironically, this would be equivalent to an infinite carbon tax. While some people might want that in the very long term, it is obviously not a good transition plan.\n\nYou are right.

If you look back in time the USA has emitted by far the most; more than twice as much as China \\[1\\].  \n.  \nThese statistics are somewhat skewed because they ignore differences in population between countries. The countries with the highest emissions \\*per person\\* might surprise you: Qatar and Curacao \\[1\\]. This is because they mine oil and have small populations \\[2,6,7\\], so there are a lot of emissions split between few people.  \n.  \nOf the major world economies, the United States and Canada have by far the highest CO2 emissions per person \\[3\\].

I actually work in the electric market/utility industry, so I\'d like to add some color to my previous comment. First even though Texas produces 30% of the nation\'s wind energy, that energy only represents less than 10% of Texas total energy usage. By and large Texas is still dependent on natural gas for its energy and coal still has a larger presence then when even though it is quickly shrinking. Among state government officials natural gas and oil are still very important industries. I have sat in meetings for the Senate Business and Commerce Committee (which somehow lacked any representatives from either Houston or Austin) where the representatives railed on wind producers for selling energy at a loss because of subsidies and for requesting property tax exemptions and thus not contributing to the local community. There\'s a strong feeling among these representatives that wind is being unfairly propped up by subsidies, which hurts competition (yes and no). \n\nAmong municipal and cooperative utilities, there\'s a strong preference for the lowest price and for reliability, unfortunately wind products don\'t often provide this-- while the wind itself may be cheap, the utility would have to procure a high risk (and thus high cost) contract to cover what the wind might not due to weather. On top of that, a lot of utilities are putting on the breaks for expanding renewables because of the fiasco that is Georgetown right now. If you look into what\'s going on there, they announced a plan to go 100% green energy, but improperly managed these products on the market, which caused them to go millions over budget last year. There are still some who are attempting to go more green, but in a smart way with lower risk, but whenever I see a proposal from a supplier to sell wind, it\'s usually an attempt to offload energy that doesn\'t work in favor for the needs of the utilities.\n\nIt\'s also worth noting that the oil and gas industry still far outpaces the renewable energy in terms of growth. Texas can\'t seem to build transmission lines fast enough to get to new oil and gas projects in West Texas, in fact ironically some of these wind products my company\'s clients use are to support energy for oil and gas projects. While Houston continues to flood (I was there during Harvey), none of my friends, family, or contacts who work in oil and gas are willing to talk about their industry\'s role in climate change. The most they\'ll talk about is protecting assets, but many of them are still surprised when they are reminded that the general public doesn\'t look so kindly toward the industry. In fact, if you listened carefully to Beto O\'Rourke\'s campaign speeches for Senate, he was very careful in how he talked about climate change and regulations on the oil and gas energy because he couldn\'t afford to lose that base. Drive around rural texas, and local communities\' industries rely on oil and natural gas-- many of their large employers make parts or provide secondary services to the oil and gas energy in a way that they just can\'t for renewables. This is why I\'ve sat at a public utility conference where a state senator opened his speech with, ""God bless oil and coal!"" I wish I made that up. \n\nAll this said, I really want wind to succeed, I want solar projects to succeed and I\'m upset that it looks like the renewable energy credits are going to expire this year because renewables are close to hitting the mark where they are cost effective for smaller communities, and I think that losing that credit will push it back several years. Back to Cornyn though, based on what I see in the industry, if he were to actually act on what he\'s saying, there would be a lot of push back, maybe not from the Shells (which are realizing they can\'t just be oil companies, but need to become energy companies with a more diverse portfolio), but from the myriad of companies that support oil and gas production. He may be actually reflecting a slowly changing opinion, but my understanding is that most of this shift is happening with younger voters who aren\'t exactly his base, so I still don\'t believe he would act on it. If he did, I honestly think he\'d lose his seat, or the state legislature would do it\'s damnedest to counteract anything done at the national level. All of this said, it definitely is an improvement that a far right Republican is at least no longer denying climate change.', 'Punish? I’m not suggesting punishing anyone. In the context of politics, they work for our votes and we vote for their work.  This professional politician in particular is repositioning his talking points in order to stay in office because climate change is now popular.  I’m here to point that out as hypocrisy.\n\nThis is not a new concept. Its akin to a wolf trying a new sheepskin outfit bc the old one went out of style. \n\nI’m saying when a politician’s beliefs flip-flop suddenly, voters who supported the prior belief should expect some kind of explanation from their representative of what changed their mind.  Cornyn, after blocking all efforts to curb emissions to date, why now the sudden change in belief? A politician is not entitled to reelection, and flip-flopping beliefs without public question or ridicule is partly how dishonest people continue to succeed in politics.  This move by Cornyn is about self-interested power maintenance UNLESS he at least acknowledges why he was wrong before and how he will act better. It’s about correcting the public record of what he stands for, or else what’s to stop him from flipping again when it’s politically expedient? Is it too much to ask an elected official to explain their change of heart? Is it punishment to vote them out when they don’t? Most democracies have a working recall system (I.e. SNAP elections in UK) to put sudden shifts of policy positions to the voters. We don’t have that working to strong effect here, so a demand for explanation is the best we can do while we wait for the next election.\n\nThe reason anyone else would come to the side of accepting climate change as truth is perhaps because they educate themselves and learn about science, fossil fuel emissions and the greenhouse effect.  It’s not about MY side or THEIR side, it’s the CORRECT side of what is scientifically accurate. THEN we can have the my side/their side debate about what to do about the indisputably factual situation.\n\nYes, vote for anyone you wish (obvious), but this guy Cornyn is a long time fossil fuel apologist and I would seriously doubt his plans to combat climate change.', 'With the hangman’s noose around his neck, the Nazi war criminal said “you know, I think the Jews are actually good folk. Can’t we all just get along?”\n\nAnd everyone applauded and all was forgiven, because the world needed to move on and work together.', 'Why? Because climate change is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed. Are you concerned that if we don’t vote for Republicans that they’re going to fold their arms like children and let the planet be destroyed? I think we deserve better leadership than that. \n\nIf you actually look at what he’s saying, he’s just tossing the 3 environmentalist GOP voters in Texas a bone because he knows he needs all hands on deck in 2020.

People can stop it.” That was the tag line of the famous “[Crying Indian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm66Ww6qTpA)” ad campaign that first aired on Earth Day in 1971. It was, as it turns out, [a charade](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-indian-crying-environment-ads-pollution-1123-20171113-story.html). Not only was “[Iron Eyes Cody](https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/05/arts/iron-eyes-cody-94-an-actor-and-tearful-anti-littering-icon.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=0B1A68F1E0FEC907277644E995743F72&gwt=pay)” actually an Italian-American actor, the campaign itself successfully shifted the burden of litter from corporations that produced packaging to consumers.\n\n> The problem, we were told, wasn’t pollution-generating corporate practices. It was you and me. And efforts to pass bottle bills, which would have shifted responsibility to producers for packaging waste, failed. Today, decades later, plastic pollution has so permeated our planet that it can now be found in the [deepest part of the ocean](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/14/trash-including-plastic-bag-found-deepest-ocean-point-earth/3664885002/), the Mariana Trench 36,000 feet below.\n\n> Here is another Crying Indian campaign going on today — with climate change.

The way it works is that you are paired up with someone from a solidly colored state who wants to vote for their solid color, for example a Democrat from California. Since you want to vote for a third party, you swap your votes with them. In California it will be much easier to get the Libertarian party up to a meaningful portion of the vote because there is little risk of letting the major party win if the third party draws away votes. In our swing states, it is much more important for the blue or red vote to be counted.

Have an internet point.', 'most of what you’re saying is misleading or outright false, so let’s cover some of it:\n\nnot sure if you’re aware of this, but politifact is basically an arm of the DNC. look at where their funding comes from, and don’t take everything they say as gospel. which is why that article re: SS is trash. it’s twisting things around in an attempt to discredit bernie Sanders, which is something they did frequently while he was running. in fact the only example they give of Biden having actually “changed his mind” was something he said while campaigning for president in 2006 (gee what a surprise that he’ll say things that people want to hear then!). the fact remains that his entire time in the senate was spent trying to cut SS or supporting bills that did in one way or another \n\nas far as your second “point” goes....fucking lol. saying that the dozens of examples of him being a fucking creep are “photoshopped by the_donald” honestly sounds unhinged. it was a known fact that he was doing these things for years and years, and just because the dems are trying to whitewash his history now doesn’t mean they never happened. for one example it was talked about on the daily show, multiple times. \n\nHere’s a large compilation of him touching little girls:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/yIWI4cxAI2M\n\nHere are a few examples of it being talked about in the media\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KkREGzfSCAY\nhttps://youtu.be/B_5QV8B6lRE\n\nI didn’t read whatever nonsense you linked about Tara Reade, I find the intensive smear campaign against a sexual assault survivor to be beyond contempt and if you choose to believe it because it fits your narrative, then that’s on you \n\nEdit: looking through your post history, maybe it’s because you’re Australian that you don’t understand why NAFTA and free trade with China are bad. It’s because all of our manufacturing jobs are being shipped to China and Mexico where they pay their workers a fraction of what they’d have to pay them here.  Our middle class has been hollowed out and destroyed because of these policies, and it’s left large swathes of our country absolutely destitute.  does this make sense to you yet?', 'Look, I wanted Bernie to win too. You\'ve seen my post history, you know I advocate heavily for left wing policies, you would see as well that I call both Bernie and Biden out when I think they are wrong. I think they\'re both fallible. You and I support the same sort of  policies, but I fear you are committing to the man, not the movement.\n\n""Not Me, Us"" is the message. We support the policies, not the people. It\'s good to push progressive candidates, but we don\'t get the progressive agenda done by wishing Biden was Bernie. Biden isn\'t far enough left for me. He isn\'t. It sucks, but there is still hope.\n\nI\'m going to skip that you\'ve ignored a lot of my arguments. I\'m interested in your feedback about the crime bill points though. I\'ll point out that I have a lot of reputable sources in my arguments. I will point out that your argument relies on a blog post, edited videos and saying you don\'t want to click the links. It\'s not good dude.\n\nYou discredit politifact? They list their sources too. You can call that all fake news and tell me again that that\'s nothing like T\\_D.\n\nThe attacks on Biden about women are meme level in their accuracy. If there were something solid behind them Bernie wouldn\'t be working so close with him. If there were something behind it then Ronan Farrow wouldn\'t have passed on it. Since when does he pull his punches? Never.\n\nOk now trade. You list jobs are part of the problem with NAFTA and it\'s true that some jobs were lost because of the deal but the USA actually gained more jobs than lost. NAFTA had a number of [pros and cons](https://www.thebalance.com/nafta-pros-and-cons-3970481) but the pros heavily outweighed the cons. I\'m not going to pretend it was all good, but major economic treaties are never 100% gain.\n\nPay and treatment of workers is a major issue which is why one of the main stipulations in the TPP was on [labour standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership#Labour_standards) which would force member countries to pay their staff better and protect unions and collective bargaining. You know, the treaty Obama/Biden were pushing. Again, the TPP wasn\'t perfect but it did a lot of things right.\n\nAnd now China. Yes, being Australian I am obviously well aware of the problems with China, but pretending that pushing for trade and for China to be less isolationist is silly. There is a big difference between trade and dependence. Trade is good, dependence is bad. It\'s hard to legislate dependence though. \n\nAustralia is heavily dependent on China in many aspects of our economy. We\'re trying to combat this by moving some of those dependencies to UK/EU/India but with the exception of India their markets are just too far away to be incredibly effective. Our problem with India is that we worry they are turning out as [bad](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgx5d4/india-is-persecuting-journalists-who-question-the-nations-pandemic-response) as [China](https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/03/06/india-among-least-free-democracies-modi-govt-threatens-democratic-future-report.html) are. But we [share](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/exclusive-india-vs-australia-test-series-the-best-rivalry-at-par-with-ashes-says-brett-lee/articleshow/77061300.cms) a lot more culture with them.', 'wait, so you want me to wade through a zillion trash politifact articles (and I didn’t say they are fake news, I said they twist information to fit their DNC approved narrative), yet you dismiss my links as a “blog post” (which is literally just a big list of different sources) and “edited meme videos” (dude these clips have been circulating for years, long before anyone would care to edit them to discredit Biden, and if you think that the behavior he’s exhibiting in them is appropriate then ask yourself whether you’d be ok with someone touching your daughter like that). \n\nyou twisted shit around in regards to the crime bill too. Biden literally said “Let me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties. That is what is in this bill. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party has 70 enhanced penalties.... The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells.”  He called it the Biden Crime Bill in his 2008 presidential run, and bragged that it encouraged states to effectively increase their prison sentences by paying them to build more prisons. He was pretty fucking proud of it and the punitive measures it contained. \n\nand for NAFTA/tpp you honestly have no clue what the fuck you’re talking about. the only ones who benefited from that were corporations. we lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, completely wiped out manufacturing in large swathes of middle america, strengthened the ability of U.S. employers to force workers to accept lower wages and benefits (because employers could threaten to move to Mexico if the workers didn’t accept lower wages). It’s central purpose was to free American corporations from U.S. laws protecting workers and the environment.  Socialism for capital and free market for labor. honestly truly you have no fucking idea what’s going on here, or any scope of how negatively it’s affected the working class here, if you think there were more pros than cons.

AI unfortunately think that if 40% of the response in r/climateoffensive and r/environment are so repellent to the idea of not eating meat, then this seems like a bigger thing to ask for than buying an electric car and personally installing solar panels on your house, which is ridiculous. \n\nIt’s really damn depressing. People don’t want to make small daily changes that they stick with, they just want to make one change that they can then write off as being their duty.', 'Really? There are more meat eaters than car drivers, this means it will be more effective for half of the cars to leave the road and nobody stops eating meat.\n\nIn fact, here I go, I by not driving any more and riding a bike help more than vegetarian Prius drivers.', 'That’s great but it’s not enough', 'Everyone also needs to fully understand one thing...\n\nThe animal (meat) isn\'t the problem. The problem is the human. This is in 2 ways:\n\n1. The AMOUNT of meat we eat, and\n2. The SYSTEMS we run our animals in.\n\nEveryone knows about the first one, so I\'ll let the rest of the thread talk about that... it\'s more efficient to just eat less meat than dream up some scenario where the entire world goes vegan. So lets start reducing how much meat we eat... but I want to focus on what people say next...\n\nWHAT TYPE OF MEAT\n\nAnd then they throw the cow under the bus. I want to really get this point across... the problems with cows aren\'t the cows, it\'s the HUMAN. It\'s the system we run our cows in. There ARE actually REGENERATIVE systems where the cow is the LINCHPIN species in sequestering carbon.\n\nAll these articles always use data from industrial feedlot environmental impacts. Trucking in feed that cows aren\'t supposed to eat. Calculating cow farts as methane releases IN THESE SYSTEMS. Calculating methane releases from massive piles of cow manure left to rot anaerobically in concentrated piles that air cannot get into. We use these numbers, then say ""cow bad"". No, the cow isn\'t bad, the human is bad.\n\nCows run in cell gracing systems, run through FOREST (or savannah - grassland/forest), in managable numbers, where they eat a natural diet of grasses/flowers/herbs/leaves and don\'t fart as much, where their manure is spread out, trampled, mixed with leaf litter and grass allowed to go to heavy carbon dry stalk because you didn\'t overgraze... in these systems the manure degrades aerobically to CO2, and NOT methane (CH4) which is 37 times worse than CO2. In these systems, soil life is INCREASED, storing carbon in their bodies. In these systems grasses are grazed and regrowth is triggered, and allowed to continue to the full life of the grass plant, stored carbon in woody stalks that are then trampled. All this carbon comes from the air.\n\nIn feedlots, cows shit on top of shit, on top of shit. They are fed corn and grain, and fart a lot. They are often on compacted depleted soils where urine and manure cannot turn into soil and soil microbiology. The air cannot infiltrate the compacted soils, and manure leachate from rains flows across compacted lands into rivers. It does not infiltrate down INTO the soil, it runs ACROSS on TOP of the soil.\n\nThe carbon footprint of the feed system is calculated - trucking in corn and grain.\n\nThe solution is eating less meat - sure. But that doesn\'t mean cows are the problem, and anytime you hear a study like this that references industrial feedlots as their case for meat, it is uninformed. And it\'s a shame, because large ruminants are CARBON SEQUESTERING MACHINES... just not when they are:\n\n1. overgrazed, such that stalky carbon growth is not allowed to happen - in order to keep grass in the vegetative state\n2. Feed is trucked in\n3. Manure is concentrated and piled up\n4. Run on compacted land (due to overgrazing), or on top of cement..\n\nThe problem is that we decided that food and life on this planet needed to become industrialized. We needed to maximize one aspect (profits) at the sake of all other aspects of the system (natural systems).\n\n**Buiding SOIL**\n\nThis is a climate change subreddit, but the problems we are facing isn\'t only carbon in the air. Another massive extinction level threat is the loss of topsoil. We have roughly 55 years of topsoil remaining if we continue industrial farming practices (most notably turning soil over via tilling, fertilizer use, monoculture (corn/soy), and herbicides, i.e. no green cover, bare soil). Cows in silvopasture systems not only prevent soil erosion, but they BUILD soil faster than just about any system on the planet, all automatically as part of their natural habit of feeding and pooping.\n\nIt\'s not just sequestering carbon, it\'s sequestering carbon in a manner that allows us to build soil. All life on this planet exists based on the fact that we have 3 inches of topsoil and that it rains. And we\'re losing our topsoil. So turning trees into furniture or biochar and planting more trees does a great job of sequestering carbon, but does little (outside of leaf litter) to build soil. At least not like a large ruminant grazing on grassland/forest.\n\nWe need to sequester carbon, yes, but we need to build SOIL also. We NEED to stop demonizing cows, as a matter of human survival, because they are one of the most important animals on the planet. Just not when we use them the wrong way. \n\n**Repeat and spread this information, please.

Elect a Democratic President AND Congress (the President will just be stonewalled by a GOP senate if we don't do both).\n\n2. Prioritize Green New Deal spending based on a cost/benefit analysis of CO2 generated in a 10-year window. This is not the time to build a millions of electric cars because the Whole Life Cycle output is green. We have 10 years to pull our asses out of the fire. A 10-year life cycle is what matters most.\n\n3. Learn and promote the word: SACRIFICE. Conserve. Reduce. Whatever the hell you want to call it, it has to be a way of life in a post-CO2 world. There just aren't enough renewables in place to get CO2 levels down AND maintain our current grotesquely consumptive standard of living. \n\n4. As part of #3: Make it patriotic and fun to conserve and social taboo to waste. Like in WWII with the homefront effort. Hollywood needs to get onboard, local politicians, churches, community organizations, Girl/Boy Scouts-- we're all about to become heroes by literally saving humanity and much of the world as we know it. We need to feel good and proud about how much of a pain in the ass it's going to be to change our lifestyles.\n\n5. Also as part of #3: RATIONS: Gas for cars and homes, electricity, meat, dairy, clothing, mileage. Anything that's nonessential needs to be cut back.\n\n6. As part of #5: RETRAINING: A lot of people are going to be out of a job in the post-CO2 economy. But we're going to need more repair shops, tailors and seamstresses, craftsmen who repurpose, energy efficient remodelers (once we get into a comfort zone for CO2 and can afford to manufacture nonessential goods), train routes, recycling centers, sailors, etc.\n\n7. Relocate coastal residents inland and convert those lands to nature reserves. Riverfront, oceanfront and some lakefront property needs to be a thing of the past. With flooding and storms, it's unsustainable from both an infrastructure support and natural perspective. We need that land as a carbon sink and natural buffer zone to absorb the weather impacts. Green New Deal can use eminent domain to buy out those areas and pay newly unemployed laborers to environmentally restore them.\n\n8. Four Day Work Week: The amount of CO2 saved if everything nonessential is mandatorily closed one day a week is huge. Airports should also be closed on that day, except for emergency purposes. The shortened week will still be considered full time.\n\n9. Hollywood needs to wake the fuck up. No more shows about bling, big houses, pimping rides, exotic gourmet meals, fabulous over-the-top anything. We need shows about cooking vegetarian, stylish thrift shop wear, growing native plants, growing food, living with a smaller CO2 footprint, etc. AND movies and tv shows need to have characters that do these things just as part of their normal day to day life. Hollywood normalized interracial marriage, working women, homosexuality, smoking pot, etc, etc, etc-- they can normalize a low CO2 lifestyle instead of glamorizing a gluttonous one.\n\n10. Jail time and financial clawbacks (all the way to the heirs and heiresses) of executives who knowingly presided over companies that are the main culprits in the current crisis. New laws that *guarantee* jail time and clawbacks for any executives who currently or in the future continue to conduct business as usual after discovering their product is integral to social/environmental harm.\n\n11. Revamp the packaged goods industry. We don't need an entire shampoo aisle. Or cereal aisle. Or snack chip aisle. Or cleaning supply aisle. Or bread aisle. Etc. We don't need freezer cases full of the same food by 10 different manufacturers. Back to basics. Keep it fresh. Keep it local. Wrap it in paper or not at all. Reusable containers from home will do, too.\n\n12. Of course a carbon tax. The bigger the better.\n\n13. Pipedream, but: A WORLDWIDE TREATY. As a single organization, the US Department of Defense is the biggest consumer of oil and the largest polluter on the planet. We cannot win a war against CO2 without stopping war on everything else.

While this is true, transportation is just one of the many sources of human fossil fuel combustion.  Electricity and heat generation account for about 25% of global humangreenhouse gas emissions alone.\n\n> Moreover, in developed countries where the 'veganism will solve the problem' argument is most frequently made, animal agriculture is responsible for an even smaller share of the global warming problem than fossil fuels.

These techniques are profitable in themselves, getting carbon sequestration money is just a cherry on top.\n\nWhere the Carbon money comes in best is as an incentive to farmers who haven't already discovered the benefits of cover-crops and no-till sowing.\n\nhere's one of his surprisingly entertaining talks on his farming methods and profitability:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExXwGkJ1oGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExXwGkJ1oGI)"", 'The WaPo article linked in this one is a much more useful source of information and includes a few of the answers to your questions. \n\n- Not just a Biden thing, cover crops have been incentivized since the 1990s and up to 1/5 of US farmland has taken up the practice since the Dustbowl\nin the 1930s.\n\n- Root crops like turnips and radishes used as cover are meant to be left in the ground, where the microbes, fungi, and insects feed on the extra watery food source as it dies. Non-root crops work the same way but it’s just less root mass to feed on. \n\n- Can’t speak to cost, but the farmer in the WaPo article says it’s a pain to farm with cover crops. I presume it’s more labor-intensive.\n\n- All contemporary science indicates the practice of tilling soil is not good. Compaction is essentially a myth. Soil that has been covered is highly porous and aerated by roots, fungi, and insects while simultaneously containing numerous “clumped” anaerobic bacteria. Tillage fractures the soil, decreasing its water-holding capacity, significantly reducing biodiversity by killing anaerobic microbes, and making it more susceptible to topsoil erosion.\n\nAt least that’s my understanding of it!', ""I am one of those that would love to get away from a cubicle and get back to the land, but that's for people that know what they're doing like Bill Gates. /s   Regeneration takes time and normally doesn't pay.

While his grandfather, who started the family farm along the Chesapeake Bay, always planted in the spring in a clean field, in Hill’s approach to farming, “you never want to see the ground.”\n\n> As the winter cover crops grow, they will feed microbes and improve the soil’s health, which Hill believes will eventually translate into higher yields of the crops that provide his income: corn, soybean and wheat.\n\n> But just as importantly, they will pull down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the ground. Hill is at the cutting edge of what many hope will provide not just a more nature-friendly way of farming, but a powerful new climate solution.\n\n\n> In early 2020, he became the first seller in a privately run farmer-focused marketplace that paid him $115,000 for practices that, over the past few years, had sequestered just over 8,000 tons of carbon in the soil. The money came from corporations and individuals who want to offset carbon dioxide produced by their activities. Hill used the proceeds to buy equipment he hopes will allow him to squirrel away even more of the planet-warming gas.\n\n> If farmers throughout the world adopted similar “regenerative” methods, experts estimate they could sequester a sizable chunk of the world’s carbon emissions. The idea has been endorsed by soil scientists, a slew of food industry giants and, recently, President Biden.\n\n> But some doubt that farmed soils can reliably store carbon long enough to make a difference for the climate — or that changes in soil carbon can be accurately yet affordably measured. Others worry voluntary measures such as soil sequestration could make a polluting food and agriculture industry appear environmentally friendly while forestalling stronger climate action.\n\n> Hill has planted rye, turnips, clover and other cover crops on a Harborview Farms field. Such ""regenerative"" farming methods have been endorsed by soil scientists, a slew of food industry giants and, recently, President Biden.\nResearchers and companies are now racing to reduce the scientific uncertainties and win over skeptics.\n\n> Many scientists are confident that farming can be adapted to build carbon into soils, said Deborah Bossio, a soil scientist at the Nature Conservancy, an environmental organization. “We know how to do it,” she said.\n\n> Agriculture has done a masterful job of feeding the world’s burgeoning population. It has been less wonderful for the climate. For thousands of years, plowing has mixed underground carbon-containing compounds with atmospheric oxygen, creating carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is driving global warming. Researchers estimate that farming throughout history has unearthed roughly 133 billion tons of carbon, an amount equal to almost 14 years of global emissions at current levels.\n\n> To prevent climate change from irrevocably damaging human civilization and the world’s ecosystems, humans must reduce carbon emissions enough to prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, scientists say. Some areas of the planet have already passed that threshold.\n\n> As scientists came to appreciate the threat posed by climate change over the past few decades, some wondered whether carbon already in the atmosphere could be captured and returned to the soil. A team led by Bossio estimated in early 2020 that if soil was protected and replenished globally, it could provide nearly 10 percent of the carbon dioxide drawdown needed to avert near-term climate catastrophe.\n\n> Soil carbon building practices, loosely gathered under the term “regenerative agriculture,” have been practiced for decades, or centuries in some places. Planting without tilling the soil took off after the devastating Dust Bowl in the 1930s spurred a search for ways to avert further soil loss, and the practice now includes more than a fifth of U.S. farmland. Maryland has paid farmers to plant cover crops since the 1990s to stanch the flow of nitrogen into the Chesapeake Bay. Some livestock producers rotate animals on pastures of grasses and legumes, whose roots pull carbon underground. And though rare in the United States today, farmers elsewhere in the world mix trees into fields and pastures.\n\n> Hill, who farms 10,000 acres, admitted he got into cover crops purely because the state paid him. “We had no intent of doing it for climate,” he said.', 'Hey I heard it on a podcast but I can\'t remember which one. It makes logical sense though since the carbon doesn\'t magically disappear, and the other guy just saying ""no"" isn\'t exactly sourced either.\n\nI\'ll keep trying to find out  either way', 'Here\'s something I found\n\nhttps://www.greenbiz.com/article/carbon-sequestration-farms-actually-working-fight-climate-change\n\n>Beyond scientific and measurement uncertainties, scientists also worry that simple biophysical limitations of soil carbon sequestration are being overlooked. USDA’s Baker notes how easy it is for carbon stored in topsoil to be released back to the atmosphere if, say, a farmer decides to till after years of no-till, or soil microbe respiration rates increase as the globe warms — something predicted by multiple studies. ""You’re not locking carbon in a vault,"" he says.\n\n>Additionally, notes Hanna Poffenbarger, a soil scientist at the University of Kentucky, no soil is a bottomless carbon sink. Even topsoil, where potential carbon gains are best documented, re-equilibrates to a stable carbon concentration after a few decades of no-till farming or cover cropping. A 2018 review from researchers in the United Kingdom noted that that is already happening in some places.\n\n>Everybody I spoke with agrees that regenerative agriculture is good for soil health and has important environmental benefits that may be worth paying for. Most believe that soils may have a role to play in drawing down carbon. But nearly all scientists also want more certainty before wholeheartedly endorsing fighting climate change using farming practices.\n\n>Says Baker: ""To rely on those for real mitigation of climate change is, I think, a risky business.""', '[deleted]', 'That makes sense, and I think that’s how people work in a lot of arenas.   \n\nHow do you know so much about what it’s like to he a farmer?', 'Do you have a link (s)? By chance?', '> But he has since become a true believer. He now mixes rye and other fast-growing grasses with legumes such as clover and lentils, whose roots host nitrogen-fixing bacteria. He also plants root crops such as radishes and turnips to loosen and aerate the soil. While most farmers kill their cover crops in March, as soon as the state allows, Hill lets the plants grow taller than he is, to maximize root mass and carbon gains. He kills them just before planting his cash crop in May.\n\n> “The longer the cover crop is alive, the better off we all are,” he said.\n\n> There are barriers that keep more farmers from following his lead, Hill said. He has had to buy specialized equipment, and climate-friendly farming hasn’t yet translated to higher yields or premium prices.\n\n> “It’s a b---- to farm this way,” he said. Turnips can get stuck in his planting equipment, costing his team valuable time, for example. “It makes life a lot more difficult, and not necessarily more profitable.”\n\n> Hill sells most of his corn to the chicken producer Mountaire Farms, which pays him the same market price other suppliers get. If farmers were paid for the carbon accumulating in their soils, they would have greater incentive to adopt climate-friendly practices, Hill said.\n\n> But implementing that idea is challenging. Carbon accumulates slowly in soil, and past attempts to pay farmers for it have failed when the costs of verifying carbon gains exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Backers of new, private-sector carbon markets hope that computer models fed by data from farm fields, satellites and handheld carbon sensors can measure and predict soil carbon gains more cheaply and reliably.\n\n> Hill connected with one of those markets, a Seattle-based tech start-up called Nori. After lengthy negotiations, credits representing carbon stored in some of Hill’s fields went on sale in October 2019 at $16.50 a ton — around the most an acre of his farmland might capture in a year, Hill said. Buyers included the e-commerce company Shopify, Arizona State University and individuals looking to offset the carbon their activities produce.\n\n> Nori eschews traditional soil tests, which can cost thousands of dollars for a large farm, and instead relies on third-party audits and a U.S. Agriculture Department computer model called COMET-Farm that estimates greenhouse gas emissions from farms.\n\n\n> Hill pulls out a root of clover mixed with the cover crops. Clover draws nitrogen from the air, storing it in nodules at the end of the roots.\n> Nori has competitors. One is Indigo Ag, a Boston-based ag-tech company that has lined up corporate customers including JPMorgan Chase, Boston Consulting Group and Dogfish Head to buy credits for carbon stored in more than a million acres of farmland across 21 states. After farmers upload their 2020 data, Indigo will calculate the amount of carbon stored and verify the numbers with a third party, a process that could take six months.\n\n> Still, the emerging market has hit speed bumps. Nori hoped to enroll more than 100 farmers in 2020, but so far, only Hill and an Iowa farmer have sold credits on the marketplace, with three more in the final stage of verification, according to Radhika Moolgavkar, a Nori program manager. At least one potential buyer, Microsoft, which has pledged to go “carbon negative” by 2030, turned down Nori’s credits because they weren’t backed by physical soil samples, Moolgavkar said. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to confirm that account.\n\n> “We’re seeing market formation in real time,” said David LeZaks, a senior fellow at the Croatan Institute, a nonprofit organization that researches sustainable investment.\n\n> The maturation of soil carbon science has complicated matters. Reduced tillage, already practiced by thousands of farmers, was once considered a major climate win because researchers saw carbon accumulate near the surface of untilled soils. But studies that sampled deeper soil layers revealed that carbon was lost there, wiping out most of the apparent gains.\n\n\n> Cover crops, whose roots and stalks add organic matter to the soil, have become the hotter item. A recent global meta-analysis estimated that if cover crops were planted on 15 percent of the world’s cropland, soils could soak up between 1 and 2 percent of all fossil fuel emissions.\u202fIn December, Biden announced he wants to pay farmers to plant cover crops, and his USDA transition team has called for setting up a “carbon bank” within the first 100 days of his administration that would pay farmers, ranchers and forest owners for climate-friendly practices.\n\n\n> The USDA already offers three-year grants to encourage farmers to grow cover crops, but those have had limited impact. A 2017 USDA census found that cover crops were grown on less than 4 percent of American cropland.\n\n> Some researchers have questioned the practice’s climate benefits. In papers published last year based on long-term research plots in Iowa and California, scientists reported that when they measured carbon in soil to a depth of a meter or more, the gains of cover crops largely disappeared, similar to what had happened to no-till. By contrast, organic farming may do more to build deep reserves of carbon, those and other studies suggest.\n\n> Last year, the World Resources Institute, a leading Washington environmental nonprofit organization, stirred debate when it published two blog posts strongly questioning whether farming practices could make a meaningful dent in climate change.\n\n> Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University and senior fellow at WRI who was the lead author of both posts, says cover cropping and other regenerative practices are good for soil and the environment generally, but their carbon drawdown rates are too low to play a major role in averting climate disaster.\n\n> “An overfocus on soil carbon is a diversion from the climate strategies that can have a bigger impact,” Searchinger said in an interview. These include restoring carbon-absorbing peatlands, reducing methane emissions from cattle and other ruminants, and increasing the productivity of existing farmland to discourage deforestation.\n\n\n> Solar panels sit in the fields at Harborview Farms. In December, then-President-elect Joe Biden announced he wants to pay farmers to plant cover crops, and his USDA transition team has called for setting up a “carbon bank” within the first 100 days of his administration that would pay farmers, ranchers and forest owners for climate-friendly practices.\n> Soil-based strategies are also limited in duration. Sequestration rates are highest in severely degraded soils, and after a few decades of climate-friendly farming, most soils become saturated with carbon — a fact not always noted by regenerative agriculture promoters, said David Powlson, a researcher at Rothamsted Research in Britain, which hosts the world’s longest-running agriculture experiment: “It’s not like getting rid of a coal-fired power station and replacing it with renewables, where exactly the same carbon savings is happening every year.”\n\n> Some fear emerging carbon markets risk wasting a rare opportunity for broader agricultural changes while giving corporations cover from more stringent climate regulations. Large industrial farmers such as Hill already benefit from a bevy of government programs, critics point out, while small-scale farmers with limited acreage will struggle to tap into markets. Expanding existing programs that pay farmers to grow native vegetation rather than crops could be a more cost-effective way to achieve climate benefits, others say.\n\n> Still, regenerative agriculture practices appeal to many experts because they’re field-tested and ready to be implemented.\n\n> “They are relatively inexpensive, relatively easy to adopt, and have a huge area of land where they’re suitable, and they have tremendous momentum and provide huge benefits to farms,” said Eric Toensmeier, a consultant with Project Drawdown and author of a recent report comparing the climate benefits of dozens of farming practices. “Cover cropping is one of the lowest hanging fruits.”\n\n> For Hill, the money from Nori was nice, but he doubts it will be enough to get more traditional farmers off the sidelines. An acre of single-species cover crops could cost $25 to $40 to plant; a biodiverse mix like Hill’s can run $65 an acre. And unlike Hill, most farmers can’t get payments from their state.\n\n> Still, between emerging carbon markets, a potential federal program and consumers waking up to the climate costs of food production, Hill is confident that he’s making a move that will be good for both the planet and his bottom line.\n\n > “Soil health,” he said, “should be the solution to climate change.”', 'That would only be true if you take everything that was grown and burn it though?\n\nActually I found this relevant bit in the article\n\n>However,\xa0according to Washington Post, this act of disturbing the soil—of breaking apart roots and exposing vulnerable microbes to the sun—has throughout human history sent up 133 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere.', ""About that comment on re-equilibriation: Did they measure where that carbon ended up?

Then this gives Biden the mandate he needs to declare the emergency. Then fast-track some climate-related bills and put them first in line for the legislative session to become laws.

We applaud that your administration has worked to prioritize climate since day one, despite many challenges. Given\nthe scope and urgency of the crisis, we request that you move to use the full power of the executive branch to combat climate change by declaring a national climate emergency. Such a declaration would unlock the broad powers of the National Emergency Act (NEA), the Defense Production Act (DPA), and the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to revitalize the economy, create millions of new, well-paying American jobs, and invest in healthy and resilient communities. Under the NEA, we can reinstate the ban on crude oil exports, suspend offshore fossil fuelnleases, curb fossil fuel imports, and halt the hundreds of billions of dollars in investments innfossil fuel projects abroad. Reining in our reliance on dirty fossil fuels is a critical part of protecting and ensuring the health of our communities, particularly Black, Brown, Indigenous, and other communities of color who disproportionately suffer at the hands of polluters. \n\nIn addition, invoking the Stafford Act and DPA will allow your administration to take essential steps toward strengthening our emergency preparedness, a critical component of dealing with the\nrealities of climate change for millions of vulnerable Americans in thousands of high-risk communities. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urges us to do just that: adapt, while protecting our most vulnerable communities.\n\nA national emergency declaration will also allow the United States to mobilize domestic industry, ramp up domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies, and deploy resilient energy infrastructure. The recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine underscores the need to\nshift from reliance on foreign oil and gas toward domestic renewable energy. We have the tools to build up a stronger renewable energy industry in America, generating millions of high-quality American jobs and rejuvenating our post-pandemic economy. \n\nWe urge you to support the National Climate Emergency Act of 2021 (H.R. 794/ S. 938), introduced by Representatives Blumenauer and Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Sanders, which mandates a national climate emergency declaration and outlines the federal response, including principles of a just transition. We do not request this declaration lightly. We recognize the gravity of invoking a president’s emergency powers. If ever there was ever an emergency that demanded this level of ambitious action, it is the climate crisis.

Do you know anything about positive feedback loops or tipping points?  This take absolutely sucks.', 'This is my opinion on the subject. The only way a capitalistic market economy doesn’t rapidly further the problem is if we can adopt a carbon tax and other market based regulations to force companies to pay the social cost for this damage. The problem is that the same corporations that exist have an incentive against regulation. These companies also have a leg up when it comes to governance due to the nature of American campaign finance, which has long and extremely costly campaigns. Even with a fairer electoral system, the richest and most powerful will always have an advantage in governance due to their larger influence in society. Many capitalistic economies have the capability to develop technology, but often the market slows transition as companies don’t actually have to pay for their current social damages without regulations, leading to polluters being more profitable than they should be. Beyond that, government bailouts, such as Ohio’s HB6, to fossil fuel companies happen regardless of the so called “free market” of society. It’s no secret that Western market based countries, despite their immense wealth and technological efficiency, often have extreme carbon footprints. I think it is impossible to continuously have regulations be forced upon companies, which have an inherent advantage over the public. The problem with companies today is that the interests of companies continue to diverge from the community at hand. The only way in my opinion to fix this is to restructure the economy and require voting shares for the workers of companies. If we encourage a policy of co-determination, we can force this community input without any government interference. My belief is that workers being members of the community would be more willing to self-regulate than shareholders, who often aren’t going to have to pay their profits towards fixing the community.', 'Have you read Friedman’s Hot, Flat, and Crowded?

I agree with you that all this talking about revolution is not working, but I disagree with the need for a revolution. I think we all need a revolution, but I think we all continue approaching this issue wrong as we continue working on this assumption that climate change is the only issue at play.\n\nIt’s no secret that oil companies hid necessary information about climate change to stop regulation. These companies are the reason climate change is a problem today. That being said, climate change doesn’t worry me the most. I’m worried about what happens after. If we have a similar environmental problem arise, will we confront it before we have the same damage or possibly worse damage? Climate change is already a thousand year long catastrophe regardless of what market regulations we create. I don’t really think it is illogical to predict that we may have similar results arising from the same system that is merely slightly modified. If my thesis that this could be only the start of many crises, then we could be facing a very bleak future. I think multiple thousand year environmental crises are simply unsustainable for civilization. We can’t afford to have a second or third or fourth crisis. That is why I don’t think modern economics can ever be reformed. We need a system that prevents these crises from arising in the first place. If we can’t develop a system to prevent externalities instantaneously, then we are going to continuously face a ticking time bomb where regulators have to continue to fight with limited information and low funding to prevent common destruction. I am fairly certain that these regulators will continue to fail under these circumstance. If we are going to make change that is truly going to be long lasting, I don’t really think we have a choice but to pursue a revolution in how we organize ourselves.', 'Feel free to share!', 'I agree, in the long run this system will not be sustainable. Whether that\'s in 75 years, 100 or even 500. And Buttigieg is my favorite too, even with his shortcomings.\n\nI disagree with the necessity for at least total revolution, I think by solving current crises, you prevent others, such is progress. With a Dem president you\'d see solutions likely across the board in terms of issues. And I do think that this is something that needs to be talked about, but I feel like ""ticking time bombs"" are just part of life. Obviously certain things are man made, but those are all still solvable. To get us to a stage where we don\'t fear these will require drastic reform. But it will happen over time, and society is really good at adapting to situations.', 'Well first you’re getting WAY ahead of yourself I feel like. Sure there could be problems in the future, but we don’t have time to be thinking about that right now, and there isn’t any scientific evidence to support that, although the depletion of lithium for solar panels IS harming communities in the Salt Flats of South America (Bolivia area I believe, the flats extend into 3 countries) Also what environmental policies has Buttigieg supported or proposed? Warren and Sanders are both supporters of Green New Deal which looks to add those taxes and incentives that capitalism can use to work towards an environmental fix.', 'I plan to get us to this level in 50 years.', 'I mean his shortcomings are pretty big imo.

My fear is more about future crises that happen in a similar manner. Climate change wasn’t the first environmental crisis, and it certainly won’t be the last. I worry that with our current system, we might have companies hide evidence that could allow us to properly prepare for the next crisis in the same vein as what happened with climate change. I worry that if we push this issue off just because it is an issue that isn’t immediately applicable, we could have the next disaster happen faster than we were expecting, and we wouldn’t be prepared for it. The best preparedness is prevention, so well it isn’t an immediate problem, we should currently be focusing energy on prevention.', ""Got any proof that we'd need it in 50?

I get that we are both in favor of the same thing here, unless you don’t want any climate action which in that case what ru doing here, but don’t stress yourself out about that fight until it’s here.', 'We need to start a complete revolution now, but I’m not talking about a traditional revolution. I mentioned 50 years as an end date for this revolution because I think it can reasonably be achieved, and I find the faster the ending, the more likely we avoid any more unnecessary environmental crises happening in the interim. I have several reasons for preferring my form of immediate revolution, which I refer to as a slow revolution by comparing it to our options.\nReform (with revolution in the future) might inadvertently cause us to be too conservative to avoid the future crises. Reform will allow us to avoid the necessary changes until it is too late. Since this could lead to a civilizational threatening catastrophe like climate change, reform as a concept should be avoided.\nI’m in favor of a slow but continuous revolution where we begin pushing the necessary structural changes immediately but at a slow pace. My biggest fear with a quick revolution is that it could divide society and necessarily create too many costs as to anger the public to the point of hatred towards the revolution’s goals, destroying the project. \nThe flaws of both reform and quick revolution are why I believe in a slow revolution with a 50 year end date in mind. I believe with a slow revolution, we can push through a system that can actually work out its kinks while we continue. To me, a slow but continuous revolution is superior to a fast revolution or reform (with a possibility of a future revolution). If we are starting with a revolution, we know that we at least took the greatest effort to avoid future crises. If we decide to push through a revolution slowly, we can say that we at least tried to prevent damages coming from changes. The great thing about a slow revolution is we will outpace the goals of both reformers and other revolutionaries. A slow revolution also allows us to push towards quicker changes if our time is right. This something that reform does  not allow us to do as reform has to work within the constraints of the system we currently have.\nFinally, here is the reason I chose 50. There is nothing specifically about making 50 a target to hit, but I think we can’t think about later dates as we risk making this transformation a reformation rather than a revolution. I see 50 as a superior goal than 75 for that reason.', 'Does this explain my view well enough to you?

Yes, I loved Obama, but Democrats still lost 1000s of seats across the country because of perceived elitism, and rightfully so. Trump won because he ran a populist campaign, and Bernie rose in the party because of similar populist movement. (Don’t forget both ran on getting rid of money in politics and self funded campaigns, which are populist messages, or appealing to everybody) Hillary was a terrible candidate, not having an economic/populist message. How many times during the campaign did we hear that “well look at how much money she’s raising from big donors!”  Trump touted during campaigns that he was getting $3 donations from people. Pete doesn’t have a populist message that resonates with people, and is propped up by large left wing media (how else would a mayor become popular? There are plenty of smart mayors) \n\nThis brings me to my main point which is that he’s an establishment democrat, which is 0/1 against Trump, and pro status quo, which EVERYBODY knows isn’t working.', 'I think an honest genius has a better ability to implement policy decisions. Policy is just words until someone implements it.', 'I definitely want to prevent climate change above all else, but I do worry that next time there won’t be a fight to fight, because we’ll be too late. If climate change has taught me anything, by the time people (rather than companies and politicians) start becoming aware of a crisis, we could be caught completely with our pants down. I do appreciate your points though, and I hope that I didn’t seem like I was discounting climate change, because I see climate change as the problem of our time along with environmentalism in general.', ""Oh that makes perfect sense, and I tend to agree actually!

The republic was set up for evolution, not revolution. The founders thought long and hard about it and knew we would need our government to grow, as we grew. They didn't even know if our govt was going to work, so they made dang sure to provide for the changes, through vote, constitutional amendment, and through the ability to make and change laws in each branch of the govt. I believe people want their rights and they want to take America back. I believe we will do this. I also believe that the people in govt. know that our system has been made to be a fool, AND that the people know it, AND that, the system as we know it is doomed because people can't even afford to live anymore and they're sick of the corruption being rubbed in their faces. The question is: Do we have a revolution and start all over, from the beginning, or do we take a system that, overall, is a good one, and try to repair it? One thing is for sure - I'd rather live here, even as it stands now, than anywhere else. Oh yes, the other thing that's for sure is this: if we don't start acting like we're actually in an emergency, we're definitely going to be extinct."", 'Yes!

I highly, *highly* doubt Bernie will win against trump."", 'Yeah brother we are on the same team I’m just saying that let’s focus on the problem at hand right now JUST for the sake of our emotional and mental stamina', 'YES, reform. See above.', 'I don’t think the American system is a particularly well designed one, or it is actually reformable to change. The presidential system at its heart is an ungovernable and monopolistic system. It is by far the worst form of governmental organization. I’m going to mention two problems about the presidental system and how these problems relate to climate change. I’m not going to mention economic problems with our American system because I feel like I beat that dead horse. Presidential systems by their nature always see an erosion of power from the other branches toward the executive branch due to the executive branch’s control of the army and police, leading to a president like Trump being above the law. People talk about impeachment a lot when this is brought up, but impeachment is a long and difficult process that can be disrupted by a president who seeks to use his executive power to stand in the way of the impeachment proceedings. Typically, presidential systems always end in a coup or a dictatorship. America is lucky so far to avoid these two options, but seeing as basically every other presidential system has failed in this manner, I think the American government has remained stable in spite of its system rather than because of it. The reason this problem relates to climate change is that one person opposed to regulations can simply choose not to enforce them. Even if we can push through all these great reforms, one corporate shill can reverse them with no recourse. The presidential system has other flaws more directly related to climate change. One person rule makes the system almost always controlled by two opposing parties or coalitions. Well two party system also usually arises from our electoral system (something we can change without an amendment), a two party system is usually strengthened by a presidental system regardless of what voting system we use. A two party system almost always leads to a polarized electorate and mutually opposed parties. This polarized electorate makes it impossible to push through changes that could be maintained after a change of government even with a president fully committed to obeying the law and separation of powers. Beyond that, it is hard to hold companies accountable when parties are dependent on them for cash in the long and expensive campaigns that result from having one party with a monopoly for the next four years. Basically, our political system is the problem. It can’t be reformed. I’d say a directorial system would possibly work, but I don’t think a presidental system and climate change reform are compatiable. The basic structure of the constitution itself can’t be changed without a peaceful revolution. Now, this revolution might come in the form of an amendment, but I do not believe that a the basic American system can be maintained while pushing through reforms.', 'I don’t totally agree with that for a couple reasons. Several candidates are capable of beating trump, because trump is a terrible president (highest he has polled is 40ish percent I think?) But if someone like Joe or Pete does win the primary, someone that takes Corp pac money which = pro status quo, after 4 years of that we will be in a political situation that gave us Trump in the first place if that makes sense. That means the primaries are INCREDIBLY important. Half of the people on the debate stage can and would beat and be better than Trump, but would it be enough? \n\nBernie’s economic message is much more supportive of the middle class compared to Biden or Pete or establishment, because establishment democrat is neo-liberal, which has shown to damage working class the most. (Neo-liberalism=globalization, and globalization killed middle class blue color jobs, like car manufacturing with robots and stuff) the economics of globalization I’m not too hot at, but Thomas Friedman articulates what I’m trying to say very well about that. \n\nOn top of that, the Green New Deal, which Bernie supports, would look to completely revamp the middle class again around those blue collar workers but towards a greener economy, while also helping those blue collar workers send their kids to college and allowing them to unionize. \n\nAlso back to ur main point about Sanders v Trump, back during the 2016 campaign, every poll had sanders doing better against trump than Hillary against trump. At the time it didn’t make sense, but when you compare the neoliberalism and status quo of Hillary’s policies vs Bernie’s middle class and working man approach, it makes sense why. \n\nIdk I’m kind of getting rambly cuz the room I’m in is super hot.', 'Well, we basically agree then. The system stinks, money rules, we need to change it, and if you want to call an amendment peaceful revolution, go ahead.

As a consequence of not being priced, there is no market mechanism responsive to the costs of CO2 emitted. The standard economic solution to problems of this type, first proposed by Arthur Pigou in 1920, is for the product - in this case, CO2 emissions - to be charged at a price equal to the monetary value of the damage caused by the emissions, or the societal cost of carbon. This should result in the economically optimal (efficient) amount of CO2 emissions.\n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

It’s a difficult transition to make regardless. Some people transition no problem, but for others it can be difficult relearning how to eat completely, especially if you’re in an environment where meat is prevalent and you’ve had very little exposure to veganism.

Probably you\'d think, ""Just as I feared, these are a bunch of closed-minded liberal jerks,"" and end up even more entrenched than before.\n\nSo if I were trying to make a constructive comment, I would probably avoid Trump and ""hoax from China"" altogether. I might say something like:\n\n""It\'s great seeing conservative groups saying they\'ll stand behind their reps on climate solutions! Liberals (like me) tend to forget that we\'re the ones that have it easy - it\'s our tribe that\'s championing the need for action on climate, so it\'s easier for us to swallow. So the Republicans that come out in support of it are being so brave. Especially elected reps, whose re-election is on the line if they go against their constituents - that\'s why it\'s important for conservative groups to speak up and tell them \'We\'ve got your back\'. ""', 'They like to claim that they\'re the ""party of Lincoln"". What about the party of Teddy Roosevelt?', '>More destructive than denying facts for 20+ years while the world burns?\n\nNo, not more destructive. That doesn\'t mean it\'s not still destructive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You’re saying Democrat’s need to be more polite to convince Republicans to act on climate change, right?\n\nThis goes way beyond being polite. It\'s about treating people with a minimum of respect and human decency, to try in some small way to heal the yawning divide between left and right that\'s threatening to swallow my beloved country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just don’t say someone needs to be nice to you in order to be convinced that a fact is a fact \n\nYou know what, I do think I believe that, in general. Social science has shown us that, unfortunately, we are not logic machines, and there\'s a lot of complicated stuff that goes into the forming of a belief. If you approach people antagonistically, you can have all the facts you want, people won\'t accept it most of the time. If I were debating with a conservative, and they started out with ""You stupid libtard..."" I would pretty much shut down to their line of reasoning.\n\nNow if the question is, have Republicans been on the wrong side of the debate on climate, historically and still largely today, of course I\'d agree. It makes my blood boil to hear some of them talk about it, for sure, and I\'ll continue to work tirelessly against that kind of obstructionism. But to go from that to ""Republicans in general are not good people"" is, I think, both unfair and destructive. \n\nEspecially when it\'s the more center-right, open minded conservatives I\'m interested in convincing, not the far-right hardliners.', 'More flies with honey than vinegar...', 'Sorry, maybe I came down a little hard on you. It\'s not just you. I hear comments like this all over the internet - all over in-person interactions too for that matter. \n\nMaybe it\'s just that the climate advocacy organization I volunteer with is stringently non-partisan. We work patiently, carefully to build coalitions and nurture relationships across the aisle. So when I hear casual comments like yours I have this feeling of ""Nooooo! You\'re undoing all our hard work!""\n\nI\'m curious - if you were a Republican on the fence about climate, and you came here and saw a comment saying Republicans are not good people, how do you think you\'d react?', 'Money is power under our current ecinomic system and the only rule to play by is gain more, who has the most money? And why would they if they had the means to not enable themselves to gain more money?', ""Your analysis is spot-on. As much as we may think and believe it, creating a space that confirms Republicans negative views on how liberals are is not helpful for anything but our own catharsis.\n\nI'd honestly be in favor of making generalizations based on political parties against the rules in subreddits like these, specifically for the reason that you've articulated. Radical, I know. \n\nThere are smart conservatives out there who are willing to listen, and we need every last one of them in this fight with us."", 'Yes, thank you for this. I grew up in a very conservative household, and still hold some conservative views, but denying climate change isn’t one of them. However, I’m pretty certain my parents still believe all of this is just part of the normal cycle, and I’ve been having to very, very slowly and carefully chip at their arguments, to hopefully change their minds so they’ll take action, or at least choose to voice their concerns to their Republican elected officials.\n\nIf they ever wandered into this subreddit and saw comments like this, they’d immediately bristle and shut down, undoing any sort of good work I had accomplished before.\n\nFWIW, having lots of people around to demean and mock me when I still didn’t believe in climate change wasn’t what finally changed my mind. It was, finally, all the undeniable facts, and one particularly poignant (for me) scene in a nature doc I was watching about coral reefs. They were studying these very, very ancient corals, and said that climate changes were evidenced in some of the oldest corals.\n\n“Oh good,” I thought. “So if the current temperature change is normal, maybe they can see that reflected in old corals?”\n\nImmediately after I thought that, they showed how none of the corals that had been around during the last “heating” of the planet looked nearly as damaged and bad as the current corals. They did a side by side comparison, and that was the moment I went, “OK, this is real, and it’s real bad, right now. I get it.”\n\nNowadays, if anyone is looking to counter conservatives’ arguments, send them the amazing videos that climate scientist and Christian Katherine Hayhoe produces on YouTube. She’s a professor in Lubbock, Texas, (one of the most conservative places you can imagine) and is married to a pastor there, so she knows the audience she’s speaking to, and answers their questions perfectly, in a non-judgmental way that still clearly states the facts.', ""Even convincing a tiny percentage of the far-right would go a long way -- they're more likely to vote in primaries, which is probably why Republican lawmakers by and large haven't had the courage to do the right thing on climate yet. [But we are making progress](https://www.chron.com/business/energy/article/Cornyn-says-days-of-ignoring-climate-change-are-13848205.php)."", 'I apologize for directing my frustrations about the political divide on climate towards you personally. I used the “you” in places I should have used “someone” or something else, and my tone was overly combative. For that, I’m sorry.\nNow, I’m not keen for a semantics debate, but I believe politeness and minimum respect and human decency in the context of Reddit commentary is synonymous enough to not pick bones about. The comment, though, is over-generalized to include all Republican voters, but I read it as just the politicians the first time. So, if so, does selling out future generations for big, easy campaign donations disqualify someone from being a good person? I think this is debatable. Do all Rs take fossil money? Not sure. Probably not. So yea, it was not the comment to mount a defense on. My bad!\nI am totally with you about communicating less combatively. I will adjust the way I go about my tone in future discussions!\nIn 2019 though, why does it require a nice person with a positive demeanor for anyone to accept climate change as fact? Yea, its persuasive sometimes. Yea, it’s a phenomenon described in social studies that people behave this way, but why does someone need to carry that burden of convincing someone else of a fact? And, when someone seriously takes opposition to a fact now taught in elementary schools, they should be shamed out of that discussion until they correct the public record (imagine a flat earth believer in a debate about which rocket to take to the moon).  It’s just baffling to me that a whole party can be unitedly wrong about an issue as big as climate change for so many years and still maintain credibility with their voters.  For me, when I found out the one thing someone adamantly argued for decades to be false actually turned out to be true, they’d lose credibility across all topics because their integrity was compromised.

Suddenly he was telling me about how he valued sustainability, because there's a limited amount of fossil fuels in the ground. We parted on good terms and he even said thanks for being out here.

From 1992 to 2005, passenger kilometers increased 5.2 percent per year. In the European Union, greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87 percent between 1990 and 2006.Comprehensive research shows that despite anticipated efficiency innovations to airframes, engines, aerodynamics and flight operations, there is no end in sight, even many decades out, to rapid growth in CO2 emissions from air travel and air freight, due to projected continual growth in air travel.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28', 'So what’s the alternative?

Yes exactly, there is none.\n\nI appreciate that you ask for alternatives and disapprove that you have to. It isn't right that people have to voluntarily care for something as important as our environment, sacrifice time to inform themselves, take the disadvantage of voluntary restriction and/or higher cost just to do the right thing.

I guess this is one of those stories where life is just cruel and unfair. I don't know how to put it in nice words. I also don't know what to do, what you should do, what we could expect from you or if we even should.\n\nStepping back, I think this situation arose from our 20th century way of life. We treated life and this planet as if we could do anything, anytime, everywhere, disregarding sustainability. Yet, unsustainable things will come to an end (or they would be, in fact, sustainable).\n\nIf we were already living in a sustainable world when you were born, when you met your partner, your relationship and family wouldn't span those long distances. Somehow, we have to reach that state again, quickly. It's cruel and unfair to those who invested (emotionally or financially) in how things currently are. On the other hand, if we continue as things currently are, it's cruel and unfair to future generations (or current generations, see this thread).\n\nI believe we have to [talk to each other and care for each other to find a solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) which somewhat works for everyone."", ""I'm not convinced and unsure what that would entail.\n\nAs long as we keep digging and drilling up fossil fuels and burn them, we increase the carbon ppm in the atmosphere, driving greenhouse effect. Only if nature would sequester that emitted carbon at least at the same speed as we emit it, it would be a stable system. Yet, fossil fuels represent hundreds of thousands of years of natural sequestration. I think the practice of burning fossil fuels inherently isn't sustainable. With less people doing it we would have more time, but would face the eventual problem anyways. \n\nIf you mean it as a solution, how so? I hope we aren't going to kill people. Are we talking about birth control? If so, it is crucial to note that birth rates and emission rates are very unevenly distributed around the globe, inversely proportional. Developed countries have high emission rates and low birth rates. Countries with high birth rates have low emission rates. As we are concerned about emissions, we should focus on high emission countries, but those already have low birth rates. I'm also skeptical if any birth control measures work fast enough, given [the limited time we have](http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/i/mitigation_curves_1.5C_190423.png).\n\nHowever, [drawdown lists _Educating Girls_ and _Family Planning_ as the 6th and 7th best solutions](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank) for reduction potential.

We already heavily damage ecosystems wherever we live in high density, I'm not sure I'll find a study specifically relating to it but its not hard to see. There are no healthy original ecosystems where cities are, yet when you get far enough out in the wilds you can have people sustainably living off the land, but at very low population densities. Maybe there is a study out there that says that just like there is a study confirming that air exists but I'm not bothering to find it. I can tell you this for certain, no high density human population has yet to live sustainably."", ""Valid points, ok.\n\nOn the other hand, living in cities allows people to specialize, and to share resources like a car, washing appliances, kitchens and so on. Efficiency increases.\n\nI don't mean to disagree with your experience, but it's just that; your experience. It's just a slice of reality just as I only perceive another slice of reality. Without somewhat objectively gathering data and comparing it, we're left with subjective opinions which may or may not represent reality as a whole. They usually don't.\n\nTheory aside, I still don't know what [your comment](/r/ClimateOffensive/comments/ekrhrw/sack_scomo_protests_in_australia/fdf4zqy/) would entail. If you propose to reduce human population, how so?"", ""On your first point, the *time* efficiency improves at the cost of sustainability. Those processes are not less damaging on the planet because they are more efficient. Also 1/10th of the population still leaves hundreds of millions of people, you will still retain the ability to specialize just on a smaller scale.\n\nThe fact that subsistence farming uses more land than industrial farming is not something that requires a specific paper, if you remove industrial processes from farming you reduce efficiency, if you reduce efficiency but keep output the same you have to increase something. There will not be a paper or study to describe all well known interactions because it we dont need people stating the obvious.\n\nAs I mentioned in my other comment, lottery sterilization is one option, across the board single child rules or just straight up killing everyone. Take your pick, I'm not saying its ethical to you but it may be required.""]"
153,Most Americans Cannot Take Time Off Work To Protest. Here Are Some Things YOU Can Do To Reduce Your Environmental Impact That Requires No Time Off Of Work:,"For most people, its not reasonable to ask them to take a week or even a day off work to strike. However, there are so many things you can do all by yourself, and in most areas there are environmental groups you can get involved with. If you really care about the environment but cant take time off to strike, or feel like protesting isnt really doing anything to help, but you still want to get involved, this post is for you. If you are planning to strike, but thats the only thing you're planning on doing, and dont know where to go next, this post is also for you. 

Changing your lifestyle a little bit at a time WILL make a difference where protesting/striking falls short. I know most people dont want to stop eating meat, but factory farming isnt just cruel to the animals (maybe you're the type who doesnt even care about animal rights 🙄) factory farming is one of the biggest offenders to our environment that you can stop supporting fairly easily. If you just simply wont stop eating meat or reducing how much meat you consume, you can change where you procure your meat from. There are local farms in most areas of the USA that care about their environmental impact, and they are not hard to find with a little googling. 

Composting at home and growing your own vegetables/fruits is a great way to recycle biodegradable items that would otherwise end up in a landfill. Composting waste is literally as easy as throwing it away, so its a great place to start. 

A lot of us know that the recycling industry is a bit of a scam, and a lot of what we put into recycling bins ends up in landfills anyways. But that doesnt mean you cant recycle. Be creative with this, you can google ways to reuse single use plastics and cardboard if you cant come up with anything on your own. We cant always stop purchasing single use plastics, but we can be conscious about what we do buy and what we so with it when we are done using it. Try to look for alternatives to single use plastics. Reusable metal water bottles, canvas shopping bags, the list is infinite. 

Growing mushrooms is another great way to grow your own food, and the act of growing mushrooms in and of itself is good for the environment. Look up Paul Stamets for more information. Its pretty easy to do and very rewarding. 

Using public transportation when available or carpooling. These things make a difference especially in areas where there is a lot of air pollution. 

And this is by no means a complete list, hopefully people will comment with more ideas, but these are meant to be easy ways to start. Just start doing something. See trash on the ground, pick it up. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant make a difference on your own or that you have to strike to make a difference. You are capable of living a life that is in tune with our planet, and its not a lot of effort to do something. 

Try to find environmentalist groups in your area and get involved on the local level. Just a google search of local environmental groups will help you find groups in your area. And if for some reason there arent any groups in your area doing something, [here is a link to a list of 34 different environmental groups that you can get involved with from anywhere. ](https://greendreamer.com/journal/environmental-organizations-nonprofits-for-a-sustainable-future) You can make a difference in your every day life.

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts.\n\n“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.”\n\nThe scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.\n“There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.”\nThe signatories of the declaration also insist that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable frenzy of the day.\n\n“There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm,” they note. “We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050.”\n“If better approaches emerge, and they certainly will, we have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world,” they state.\nIn particular, the scientists criticize the general-circulation models of climate on which international policy is currently founded as “unfit for their purpose.”\n“Therefore, it is cruel as well as imprudent to advocate the squandering of trillions on the basis of results from such immature models,” they propose. “Current climate policies pointlessly, grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, continuous electrical power.”\n“We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation,” they declare.', ""Now that thousands of scientists have declared that we are in an emergency, what would you like to see accomplished?  So far I've seen calls for a) abandoning Capitalism, b) abandoning Democracy, c) destroying animal agriculture and enforcing vegan diets on everyone, e) abandoning all fossil fuel based energy systems, including electricity production, heating, etc. d) not having children and I guess, making deforestation illegal, moving everyone into massive city complexes and giving 75% of the land back to nature.\n\nWhen do we get started?  Will you use death squads to enforce this move to our new, enlightened utopia?"", ""I found 50 scientists who don't believe in climate change. Checkmate alarmists!"", '>the world will end in 12 years if we do nothing.\n\nNo, this is not the message. If we don\'t make major changes to our our economy to severely cut carbon emissions by 2030, we will lock in long-term changes that will be really devastating. Note: not devastating changes *in 2030*, but devastating changes that be unavoidable over a longer period. Imagine taking an ice block out a freezer and into a warm room: the ice will melt, just not immediately when you bring it into the room.

That is compounded by military and civilian hacking of national infrastructures and military assets. Why? It's cheaper and easier to attack the US Navy with missiles and hacks and no one can go toe to toe with it conventionally. Also, you don't need to bomb factories when a virus can cause manufacturing lines to destroy themselves. The US is woefully unprepared in every way for the next war. We're excellent at stomping conventional armies, but we are going to be seriously screwed if we ever kick off without transitioning into this new era of warfare.\n\nAll of that being said, weaponry is not fuel efficient. Just look at any military vehicle out there. It's also an Achilles heel of the US military because, without access to oil, we're grounded. Huh...I wonder if that has happened before to anyone out there fighting a major conflict in the oil age...Germany? Japan? The US Military will never switch to fuel efficient, alternative, or renewable energy for reasons ranging from practical needs of conventional warfare to the military-industrial complex and its workings.

I fall into the camp of inevitable because of my research and experiences in a war. Stupid and short-sighted decisions from poor or misinformed leaders result in conflict. If I had an algorithm to measure those and apply it to conflict predication, I\'d be using exponents right now on those variables.\n\nA recent conference on power transition I attended discussed both transition theory and balance of power theory in three lenses. The first economic, the second philanthropic colonialism, and the third sheer military might. Each has give and take that keep the US and China from engaging in something direct, but it\'s tenuous. There are plenty of scholars and research suggesting a war with China is not only possible, but feasible IF one of those three things breaks (for a rough idea of that, see Freidburg, 2006). Though Freidburg\'s study is over a decade old now, it has some interesting insights into the development of Chinese power and the different thoughts on conflict. We can compare the analysis to what is happening today for what, I think, is a grim outlook.', ""That's literally what I was referring to lol"", "">There are plenty of scholars and research suggesting a war with China is not only possible, but feasible \n\nI'm not denying that it is a possibility, certainly it is. But what I'm saying is that with China, just as with Russia and the Soviet Union the following holds true: even without nuclear weapons, any direct conflict between the large powers would be so messy and economically devastating to all parties involved, that from a purely game theoretical stand point the chances of that happening are not all too great (at the moment, this may change in the future obviously). Put another way: no side has anything significant to 'win' in such a conflict, it's a lose-lose -scenario for both sides as the cessation of trade relations caused by war alone would send massive shockwaves through the economy of both. Not to mention that the US has not in fact engaged a large, organized state-lead army really since Vietnam.\n\nKeep in mind that during the cold war, there were plenty of people who held direct non-nuclear conflict between the US and the Soviet Union likely, or even unavoidable, but that too didn't happen even though the economies were much more detached from each other.\n\nWith the level of dependency of many large-scale US corporations on Chinese manufacturing being as high as it is, there is very little strategic sense for either side to escalate tensions to the point of all out war.\n\nT""]"

Of course it will be winter soon and then she will want to go by bus, but only as long as it is a diesel bus.\n\nSomehow, that does not seem to be conducive to ‘helping the Climate’.\n\nOf course, she is now asking for an electric bicycle, but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the planet as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles, so she will be pedaling, or walking. Which will not harm her, or the planet. We used to cycle and walk to school too.\n\nSince the girl on TV demanded “we need to get rid of our dependency on fossil fuels” and our daughter agreed with her, we have disconnected the heat vent in her room. The temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in the evening, and will drop below freezing in the winter, we have promised to buy her an extra sweater, hat, tights, gloves and a blanket.\n\nFor the same reason we have decided that from now on she only takes a cold shower. She will wash her clothes by hand, with a wooden washboard, because the washing machine is simply a power consumer and since the dryer uses natural gas, she will hang her clothes on the clothes line to dry.\n\nSpeaking of clothes, the ones that she currently has are all synthetic, so made from petroleum. Therefore on Monday, we will bring all her designer clothing to the secondhand shop.\n\nWe have found an eco store where the only clothing they sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen, wool and jute.\n\nIt shouldn’t matter that it looks good on her, or that she is going to be laughed at, dressing in colorless, bland clothes and without a wireless bra, but that is the price she has to pay for the benefit of The Climate.\n\nCotton is out of the question, as it comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for it. Very bad for the environment.\n\nWe just saw on her Instagram that she’s pretty angry with us. This was not our intention.\n\nFrom now on, at 7 p.m. we will turn off the WiFi and we will only switch it on again the next day after dinner for two hours. In this way we will save on electricity, so she is not bothered by electro-stress and will be totally isolated from the outside world. This way, she can concentrate solely on her homework. At eleven o’clock in the evening we will pull the breaker to shut the power off to her room, so she knows that dark is really dark. That will save a lot of CO2.\n\nShe will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts, nor will she be going on anymore vacations with us, because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle.\n\nSince our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 emissions and footprints of her great-grandparents are to blame for ‘killing our planet’, what all this simply means, is that she also has to live like her great-grandparents and they never had a holiday, a car or even a bicycle.\n\nWe haven’t talked about the carbon footprint of food yet.\n\nZero CO2 footprint means no meat, no fish and no poultry, but also no meat substitutes that are based on soy (after all, that grows in farmers fields, that use machinery to harvest the beans, trucks to transport to the processing plants, where more energy is used, then trucked to the packaging/canning plants, and trucked once again to the stores) and also no imported food, because that has a negative ecological effect. And absolutely no chocolate from Africa, no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia.\n\nOnly homegrown potatoes, vegetables and fruit that have been grown in local cold soil, because greenhouses run on boilers, piped in CO2 and artificial light. Apparently, these things are also bad for The Climate. We will teach her how to grow her own food.\n\nBread is still possible, but butter, milk, cheese and yogurt, cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2. No more margarine and no oils will be used for the frying pan, because that fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew.\n\nNo ice cream in the summer. No soft drinks and no energy drinks, as the bubbles are CO2. She wanted to lose some pounds, well, this will help her achieve that goal too.\n\nWe will also ban all plastic, because it comes from chemical factories. Everything made of steel and aluminum must also be removed. Have you ever seen the amount of energy a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter? Uber bad for the climate!\n\nWe will replace her 9600 coil, memory foam pillow top mattress, with a jute bag filled with straw,with a horse hair pillow.\n\nAnd finally, she will no longer be using makeup, soap, shampoo, cream, lotion, conditioner, toothpaste and medication. Her sanitary napkins will be replaced with pads made of linen, that she can wash by hand, with her wooden washboard, just like her female ancestors did before climate change made her angry at us for destroying her future.\n\nIn this way we will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction, water levels rising and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.\n\nIf she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of the girl on TV, she will gladly accept and happily embrace her new way of life.', '[deleted]', 'Are there more like potholer out there?', ""As much as I think this is stupid, I still think it would be wrong to ban posts like this since they aren't causing direct harm to anyone; they are just from a different viewpoint; a stupid one, sure, but they should be allowed to share what they believe if they want to."", ""> The majority of denial is from ~~the older generations.~~ the political right who put profit over people - as they always have.

So, by process of elimination, driving a car is bad for the environment.  The question is, is driving in a car bad enough for the environment that we can\'t allow it to happen, or will the environment be able to adapt at a lower, but still manageable, state?  One human driving one car is ""bad,"" but inconsequential.  Humans driving 1000 cars is bad, but still inconsequential.  Humans driving a billion cars is bad, and has significant consequences.  Humans driving 3 billion cars across the planet, along with motor scooters, trucks, buses, trains, ships, airplanes, and other petroleum powered equipment is bad enough that the consequences are beyond what the environment can handle long term, and we absolutely need to find a way to find alternatives that are less damaging.\n\nI fully agree with the idea of having less impactful lives.  I don\'t agree with the over-the-top, the world is going to end in a decade or two rhetoric being used today by the Climate Change industry.

It is best done clandestinely. In essence, it\'s similar to guerrilla warfare, in that the objective to so cause small but numerous headaches for the enemy, undetected. This makes it appear as though anyone could be doing this, at any time, anywhere. It\'s difficult for an organized top-down group (e.g. police, security, industry) to stop, as it can happen so fluidly, so quickly, and can adapt faster than the hierarchical groups which aim to combat it.\n* The goal is to **target equipment/vehicles/tools and NOT people. Harm the devices which enable logging, NOT the people operating them!!!**\n* **This** [**excellent guide on monkeywrenching**](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/various-authors-ecodefense-a-field-guide-to-monkeywrenching#toc101) **techniques is a great place to start**\n\n# Tow straps and chains as barriers?\n\nIf protesters wanted to be really effective against police trucks, logging equipment, and other vehicles, I believe the best thing to do would be to use a tow strap across the road, attached to two solid objects. A 3""x30"" strap would be the minimum choice. You could easily fit one in a backpack and deploy it quickly. Even with a steel plate bumper, a truck would suffer damage trying to break through it:\n\n[This is a good example of what I mean.](https://youtu.be/7BbCX9AHTuQ?t=110) The only difference here is that the strap is sandwiched in a metal tube, but the strap itself is the part that absorbs the kinetic energy of the vehicle. By attaching it to other heavy objects on the side of the road, anything that attempts to ram is effectively stopped or destroyed.\n\nIf you REALLY, absolutely, positively wanted to stop people from dismantling your barrier by hand; use two lengths of minimum 3/8"" [Grade 70 chain with slip hooks](https://www.discountramps.com/images/xxl/G70-38-FH.jpg?v=100114446665-2) and tension them together with a [come-along](https://shop.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_17604.jpg) before linking the ends with a [bow shackle](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1437/3266/products/DSC_5201_1024x1024.jpg?v=1513950771) or the slip hooks, if that works.

These straps usually have an ultimate break strength of 17,000 lbs, so there\'s no way they\'re getting away if caught at a standstill and the strap is attached to something springy, like a tree.\n\nIt\'s like how they stop the AT-AT\'s in Star Wars... but with offroad recovery straps!\n\nBecause this guide was originally made for Hong Kong protesters, apply the following to your needs: (see this [HK Police\'s UNIMOG](https://i.imgur.com/7OosHGD.png) diagram).\n\nA tow strap could be attached to anything circled in yellow, and a tree, or some other heavy object on the side of the road. **If the snorkel circled in red could somehow be blocked, the engine would receive no oxygen and stall.** Due to the purpose of a snorkel (water fording) it makes sense that this is the only air intake for the engine.\n\n# Expanding foam to disable vehicles?\n\n* [AB liquid foam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUB1GU_tvpI), which can be exposed to air until mixed together - it      begins to expand after 30 seconds.\n* [Canister spray foam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RnQX22FsNA), which comes in a can similar to spray paint. It      begins to set once exiting the can.\n\nExpanding construction foam would near-instantly block the snorkel, and the engine would starve of oxygen quickly. Effectiveness depends on if the air filter is on top of the snorkel or inside somewhere in an air box. Most designs include the filter at the top of the snorkel, and it may be possible to be forcibly pulled off. Ideally, you need to get the foam past the filter.\n\nExpanding foam could applied with the following methods:\n\n* Puncture a canister of spray foam then *immediately*  throw the canister into the vehicle\'s air intake, or let it ooze out into the intake.\n* Fill a bag with mixed AB foam, then *immediately* toss it down the snorkel. The foam should expand and block off the snorkel, and/or pour out. If it pours out, there\'s a chance [it could cause a runaway diesel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine_runaway) Great way to destroy an engine!\n* Use two part AB foam, pour both into a balloon, tie the balloon, shake it, and throw into a snorkel, air intake on a vehicle, at anything else you want to hit.\n\n# Fishing nets with barbs to entrap or destroy vehicles?\n\nProtestors Might also consider using spiked nets:\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4870602/Police-reveal-spiked-net-stop-vehicle-terror-attacks.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4870602/Police-reveal-spiked-net-stop-vehicle-terror-attacks.html)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77cNfruMsc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R77cNfruMsc)\n\nThey wrap around the axles and immobilize the vehicle forcing the officers to abandon it.

That's because they see Biden as someone that can be pressured to move tangible climate actions in a much better direction than the current climate-change-denying president. But the pressure has to be there after the election to make sure Biden holds to the investments and policy implementation that he has propose. It won't happen if he doesn't feel it is a big enough issue for the public and for his re-election next cycle. Whereas Trump can't be influenced to do anything for the environment. Seeing as the IPCC is calling on nations to reduce their net carbon emissions in half in just 10 years, it makes a big difference what happens over the next couple of election cycles. \n\nThe Greens have nice progressive policies but very little power. Bill McKibben suggested they focus on doing work towards promoting electoral reform (e.g. ranked choice voting or approval voting) for future elections since that could be some good grassroots work that doesn't require holding political office. Some states are already there or getting there at the state level. \n\nFinally, don't forget, big progressive societal changes happen because society is moving in that direction, not because of the political system. Women's right to vote happened over time internationally because that's how society was moving. The move towards climate action is a global movement. What matters is to get rid of as many hurdles as possible to accelerate change and right now Trump is a big hurdle for the US. The science community agrees and many environmental groups agree. These people are not naive about the history of politics. But there is a way to fight for electoral reform and its time is coming. Meanwhile, there is a big hurdle for the environment that needs to be removed. This isn't my opinion, it's the opinion of the science community and many environmental groups.""]"

If you split the fight into two bills, you use all your resources fighting to pass the first one, and then republicans and centrist dems turn around and say “we already got healthcare passed, the radical communist dems are trying to overturn our healthcare! We already fixed healthcare!”\nWarrens plan has almost literally 0% change of passing fully, Medicare for all would never be accomplished. With Bernie’s 1 Bill, there is atleast SOME chance. \n\nBernie would call on the American people to rally and march on Washington, do a general strike if necessary to force politicians to comply and pass Medicare for all. Warren would not. \nBernie would go to his dem opponents home states and stand behind progressives that agree with his policies, and get the people to vote out corporate dems out in the midterms so progressives have a majority in the house and senate. Warren herself said she wouldn’t support primarying corporate dems. \n\nBernie’s plans are not too extreme nor would they balloon the deficit, his plans are 100% laid out with how they are paid for. His policies save 16 trillion$ over ten years, warrens do not. \n\nPlease. Bernie is our only shot. He already has the most name recognition, highest favorability, most individual donors, most individual donations, most volunteers by far, fastest to 1 million donation, most individual donations of any candidate in history at this point.  Bernie is has been saying the same things for 40 years. Yes he is old but if he picks a strong vp, even if he dies in his first term it won’t matter, warren isn’t that much younger anyway. \n\nIt would be great to have a woman as president, but her policies arnt as strong and she isn’t as hard of a fighter.

He would spend a lot more to tackle the issue and cover more bases, faster than warrens plans. \nBernie’s plan isn’t enough to stop climate change. But warrens is much less than enough. \nSanders would spend 16 trillion compared to warrens 3 trillion. Bernie’s plan is all encompassing, including preparing people for the impacts of climate change by guaranteeing housing, healthcare as a right, and universal higher education. His Green New Deal would garuntee anyone a job if they want it, to create 20+ milllion jobs to create renewable energy infrastructure and repair roads, water pipes, etc. \n\nThe money, according to Sanders, will come from sources including income taxes from 20 million new jobs, taxes on fossil fuels, defense budget savings from no longer protecting oil shipping, and selling power via federal power marketing authorities.\n\nThat money would then be spent on measures like a climate resilience fund, deploying renewable energy, building a high-voltage direct current network, and supporting the United Nations Green Climate Fund.\n\nSanders also takes the most aggressive line against the fossil fuel industry. In addition to raising taxes on the industry and pursuing civil litigation, Sanders wants criminal prosecution of greenhouse gas emitters like Exxon Mobil.\n\nSanders\' plan aims to reach a 100% renewable transportation and electric grid by 2030, as well as ""complete decarbonization"" by 2050. It would also declare climate change a national emergency and pledges to create more than 20 million well-paying jobs.\nMost significantly, Sanders\' plan calls for a total end to federal investment and subsidies in the fossil fuel industry, which comprises the bulk of the American energy sector.\n\nTo achieve that, Sanders told the audience at Georgetown University that 20 million jobs would be created to retrofit buildings, manufacture solar panels and wind turbines, electrify the transportation system and build a new high-speed rail system. The plan also commits to working internationally to hold other countries to their commitments and to help poorer countries make the green transition, in recognition of the United States’ historical contribution to global emissions.\n\nSanders is the only candidate to get an A on his climate plan from Greenpeace; Sen. Elizabeth Warren got an A- and former Vice President Joe Biden originally got a D- before making revisions for a B+. Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, gave Sanders and Inslee “very thorough” rankings on their climate plans with Sanders addressing 44 out of 48 components of a Green New Deal, while Warren\'s and Biden’s plans were deemed “thorough.” And the political director of the Sunrise Movement, a high-profile youth environmental group pushing for the Green New Deal, declared Sanders’ plan “the biggest and boldest plan and vision out there.”\n\nWarren, by contrast, is approaching the climate crisis as a problem of corruption. She has a comprehensive plan that includes part of what Inslee proposed, but it includes much less spending than Sanders’ and a greater reliance on private corporations taking action once market incentives are reshaped with new regulations, taxes and programs. Sanders believes the scale of necessary change will require more government intervention.\n\nThe two largest emitting sectors in the United States are transportation and electricity production, accounting for 29 percent and 28 percent of total emissions, respectively. All of the candidates have plans to move from fossil fuels to renewables, but Sanders supports public ownership of utilities while Warren does not. Taking utilities out of the private market would allow for a more rapid transition because the government would directly decide how electricity is generated instead of trying to influence private companies. \n\nBut transportation is where all the candidates still have the biggest blind spot. They’re happy to talk about electric vehicles, but there’s often little else of substance in their transportation plans. The exception, again, is Sanders. Ahead of the CNN climate town hall, Curbed’s Urbanism Editor Alyssa Walker wrote that only Sanders has a transportation plan that goes into detail on measures beyond electric vehicles, including expanding public transportation, promoting transit-oriented development in cities and increasing residential density. Even Sanders’ plan doesn’t go far enough — but it goes much farther than anyone else’s.', 'That’s the thing about warren, she’s kind of... misleading. She claims to not take big money donations, which technically is true for 2020 presidential race from strictly 2020 donations,  but a lot of her money was transferred over from her 2018 senate race and the previous ones, which she took large amounts of big money donations from corporations. \n\nBernie has never taken large corporate donations in any of his races ever. Warren uses loopholes to funnel billionaire donations into her presidential campaign but can still technically say she isn’t currently accepting billionaire money. \n\n\n“Sanders’ campaign proudly says “not a single billionaire has donated to our campaign.” It is promoting “Billionaires Should Not Exist” stickers and posted an anti-endorsement list of billionaires who have bashed Sanders. One of them [who bashed Bernie] is entertainment mogul Haim Saban, who gave $5,400 to Warren in 2018 for her Senate campaign.\n\nForbes looked at big-money donations in the 2020 cycle in August and found that Pete Buttigieg had the most billionaire donors so far at 23, followed by Sen. Cory Booker with 18, Sen. Kamala Harris with 17, Sen. Michael Bennet at 15 and former Vice President Joe Biden at 13. Warren had three. Sanders had none.\n\nWarren transferred more than $10 million from her Senate campaign to her presidential campaign. Federal records show that she got Senate support from David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks, John Tu, president of Kingston Technology Corporation, philanthropist George Soros, Stewart and Lynda Resnick, owners of The Wonderful Company, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nTom Steyer, the hedge fund manager, gave $5,400 to Warren in 2018 before launching his own White House bid. Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, also gave to Warren.  Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff gave $5,400 to Warren in 2017, before he was getting pressure to stop his software contract with US Customs and Border Protection over President Trump’s family separation policies.”\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2019/10/14/elizabeth-warren-has-a-history-of-collecting-cash-from-billionaires/amp/', ""I'm not American, but from my viewpoint the USA has shifted wayyy farther to the right than it was during previous republican administrations. You need a strong leftist, socialist force to counter that, to embolden people to stand up to Trumpism (Fascisms' boring, stupid, dystopian little retarded cousin). Bernie isn't actually all that socialist by European standards, he's pretty much middle-left over here. However I think it's as far as Americans would be willing to go, so that's a good start.\n\nI do think he actually stands a good chance of motivating Americans to overcome their differences and vote in a new generation of more progressive, less capitalist-oriented politicians to take their swing at things. Think AOC, there's plenty people like her walking around and they're a growing force nowadays. They're popular among voters as well. Nobody expects US presidents to be able to carry out all their promises, but with a strong, growing progressive faction in the House and Senate, that might be different after 2020. Bernie has been pushing the entire Democratic platform left since 2016 and I don't think he'll stop, he's already using his influence to boost progressive politicians and they're boosting him as well (again, the AOC/Bernie partnership). \n\nTaking on the fossil fuel industries will require bold leadership, people willing to step away from corporate money, a definitive end to corporate sponsorship of US politicians. Mostly, we need a person to push through aggressive carbon taxes in the next decade. I don't see that coming out of Buttigieg. Not because he doesn't *want* to, but I fear he'll get stonewalled by the establishment. There's much less chance of that happening with Bernie, since he's... I'm not gonna call him an outsider, because he's a career politician, but the man doesn't seem to lie about his convictions and he's got the track record to prove it. I doubt that would change during his administration. \n\n> and I think it’s suffice to say that the current administration staying is the worst outcome of this in terms of climate action.\n\nOh I absolutely agree on this, even Biden would be better than Trump, and Buttigieg would also be better than Biden. Any of the current Democratic candidates would bring about a nice fresh breath of stable, lawful, relatively scandal-less leadership and that would be a godsend by itself. I think most people realize that and whoever the Democratic candidate has a good shot at beating Trump (except for Biden, I'm convinced he's gonna cause Hillary 2.0, shoot-yourself-in-the-foot-Electric-Boogaloo scenario).

(And before you say it, yes that supermajority was not comprised of progressive champions... but they were much farther to the left than any Republican in office). \n\nI will rejoice with you if Sanders is elected and subsequently passes these reforms. I would certainly rather have him in office than Mayor Pete or Biden.

Whenever dems compromise, it’s only over increasing war, tax cuts for the rich, increasing illegal spying. Why? That’s the only things republicans will ever compromise on. If they don’t get their way, they refuse to cooperate. So dem proposals are continually watered down until it’s basically meaningless, which is how we got Obamacare, which, while an improvement, was republican mitt Romney’s healthcare proposal in Massachusetts. \n\nThe way to get policy passed is to rally the American people behind the issues, which they overwhelmingly support almost all of Bernie’s policies, so if he tells them to vote out his opponents to get the policies they already want implemented, chances are, they will be voted out.  The vast majority want stricter gun control, environmental regulation, universal education and healthcare, and a long list of other things. Like 70% for each. He can rally the people (fight), get them to stand behind him on issues they already support, and get a progressive majority. \n\nThat will NEVER happen with someone like warren or Pete. Warren will get some good tweaks and plans, like fairer consumer protection and wall street regulation, but there’s 0% chance she could get actual systemic reform in. The only person who can do that is bernie.', 'This is all well and good but the electoral college still currently exists.

There is not a world in which progressives form a majority in the Senate in 2020. \n\nBy your logic, the strength of Bernie’s grassroots movement will inevitably sweep both chambers with progressives. Nothing is inevitable. Politics is a game of probability. I find the insistence upon an inevitable political future that is not within the current realm of probability odd. \n\nAnyway, feel free to revisit these comments in one year.

Moderate Democrats are not good, but they are far better than every single member of the GOP (a Democrat simple majority in the Senate, for example, would not have confirmed Brett Kavanaugh.

210,"The IPCC Report Scared Me At First, But Then It Motivated Me To Get Off My Ass and Start Doing My Part","For a while, I’ve been a pretty casual observer of climate change, and every single experience I’ve had reading about it has been nothing short of negativity. Everything I was reading was defeatist or hopeless, saying that we have no way to change our course for the better. For a while, I submitted to that idea, thinking that there was nothing I could really do, nothing that I could change for the better.

After reading the IPCC report and all the negativity that came with it, I started to feel those same feelings of fear and anxiety. My mind began racing towards those same doomsday ideas and defeatist ideas that left me too sick to do anything about the problem. However, I started to look back to other moments in history where humanity’s future was questioned, and what individual people, no matter the resources or knowledge that they possessed, did to make sure that they left a lasting impact on the advancement of the human race.

I’m here to tell you guys, and especially anyone discovering this sub today, that I am ready to do my part. I’m done with being afraid. I’m done with not knowing what the future holds. I’m done with the idea that there is nothing that I can do. Because in reality, we have so much that we can do to change the course for our future generations. 

You may be feeling down or afraid, which is frankly understandable in today’s hysteria in the news and in Reddit comments. But after today’s report, there are still many chances to do something about this problem and fix it once and for all. Pick yourself up, dust off the negativity, help someone else up, and charge into action. Humanity has come together to defeat the most daunting challenges. WE can do that once again.

Now let’s fucking do this.

EDIT: My ways of taking action at the moment are as follows:

-	Join a climate action group and become a donor 
-	Write to my representatives on a relatively frequent basis 
-	Monitor my water usage and become more diligent about my consumption
-	Recycle as much as possible

We already check off most of the list below and plan to have all of the difficult and costly stuff done by next year (electrifying our house and getting an EV).\n\nHopefully this list we made up can make it easy for others to focus on taking on one thing at a time!\n\n*Easy stuff:*\n\n* **Compost your organics.**\n* Buy a compost bucket or just have a compost pile in your backyard. Make sure all organic waste is deposited in your compost pit instead of the garbage bin and ultimately landfills.\n* **Buy or make a rain barrel.**\n* You can easily buy or make a rain barrel. I bought a kit that has a well thought-out adapter that plugs into the side of my downspout. This will effectively give you a storm water storage tank to water your native plants with. It also aids municipal storm infrastructure by storing of storm water at the source.\n* **Turn off your outdoor house lights at night.**\n* Google  'Dark Sky movement' to understand why. Basically a lot of insects and  life depend on their natural circadian rhythm. Let's stop messing around with that.\n* **If you have a cat as a pet, keep it indoors.**\n* Cats  are an invasive species and hunt down whatever they can  get...especially song birds. There's a lot of song birds that have declining numbers and cats contribute to this. Keep your cats inside and under control, just like any other pet.\n* **Don't purchase useless products.**\n* Think of that show with Marie Kondo and purchase/keep stuff that you give some real thought about; if you deduce that product as improving your life, then great! If not, don't bother. Buy used stuff where possible. If used isn't available, buy local.\n* **Inform your local municipalities to adopt new by-laws.**\n* Propose new regulations/bylaws for tree cutting/conservation (ban cutting of native trees).  Inform your municipalities to bring in cat control by-laws similar to existing dog control by-laws.\n* **Recommend your state or provincial government towards new regulation.**\n* Propose to regulate and ban the selling of invasive and non-native vegetation at nurseries and landscape companies. Propose the banning of pesticides. Propose tax credits to home-owners and farmers to plant native plants/trees, etc.\n* **Tell your non-right leaning friends and family to watch the latest David Attenborough documentaries.**\n* Do not waste your time and effort trying to convince hard right-leaning family members. It's crushing to attempt it...I hate to generalize but red-necks and some boomers are pretty stubborn and have lived comfortable lives. They don't want to change that. Educate people who are already more progressive or even centrist. They are usually more open-minded and fact-seeking.\n\n*Medium Level stuff:*\n\n* **Minimize eating meat and over-consumption of products with palm oil and soy.**\n* You don't have to stop eating meat, but try eating meat once a week or so...make the change gradually and its hardly noticeable. Palm oil and soy over-consumption leads to loss of habitat due to mass deforestation;  on top of the obvious issues with current agricultural practices.\n* **Buy food from local markets and buy organic where possible.**\n* We need to stop supporting pesticide, methane emission, and manure run-off based agriculture.\n* **Do your research on native plant species in your area and plant them on your property**\n* Do your research on identifying invasive species and remove them when you see them. Plant native (to your area) plant species on your property instead.\n\n*Difficult/Costly stuff:*\n\n* **Get rid of the gas powered utilities in your house:**\n* Replace your gas stove with induction or electric (induction is best and most efficient, but expensive).\n* Replace  your gas furnace with electric air handler plus replace your A/C with an air or geothermal sourced heat pump. Air source heat pump + Air handler is a very efficient combination (~300% efficient).  Slightly more costly up-front for air sourced. Much more expensive up front for geothermal - geothermal is most efficient (~400% efficient).\n* Replace  your gas dryer with an electric dryer. We actually hang our clothes in  our basement over the winter. We do not have a dryer at all.\n* Replace your gas hot water tank with an electric unit or a hybrid electric unit with built in heat pump.\n* **Replace your aging or high mileage car with an electric car**\n* This should be your main savings priority even above the house stuff - petroleum based energy is worse than natural gas.\n* **Replace your shingles with solar shingles or add panels**\n* Tesla's  solar shingles still haven't yet ramped up to full production but it will probably happen in the next few years. Panels can be had now though.\n* **Consider having less or no kids**\n* I cautiously put this one here as most people find this a touchy subject. If you still want kids, then it's definitely a personal decision; although hopefully/maybe you will consider fostering or adopting. On the flip side, some of us can raise some amazing environmentally-aware children too.\n* **Donate money or time to local, state, provincial charities that support the environment and conservation of natural areas**\n* Land Trusts or Environmental lobbying groups probably make the most impact. If you are low on money but have spare time, then donate your time.\n* **Minimize Air Trail**\n* This requires a bit of a mindset change as well. Traveling isn't a mandatory thing. Some people view overseas vacations as an annual necessity. It's not. What makes people happy is spending time around good friends and family as well as new positive experiences. Those experiences can be had by local travel by car or train."", ""[This blog](https://debunkingdoomsday.quora.com/1st-response-to-IPCC-report-confirms-predictions-of-previous-reports-minor-changes-able-to-be-more-exact) has helped me make sense of the report and where we're headed.

216,Honolulu City Council Agrees To Sue Oil Firms For Climate Change Damage. The city contends the fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil knew their products would harm the environment while they collected billions in profits.,,"['Honest question I’ve been meaning to ask: what law was Exxon breaking? Clean air act? I’ve heard of a couple groups wanting to sue, but what specific law are they stating the oil companies have broken? \n\nThe best I could find was San Francisco and Oakland suing for oil companies being a “public nuisance”. Which doesn’t sound very compelling to me.', ""There are many different possible theories. The first would be fraud, which is the intentional misrepresentation of known facts. For example, if you have a product that internal testing shows causes cancer, but then you release public statements saying that it does not cause cancer and that there is no evidence of it, then that's corporate fraud on the public that is the basis of tort theory. Aside from common negligence, fraud usually opens up the defendant to punitive damages in addition to actual damages. In this case, the oil companies have had internal research that has been telling them of the harm of their product for decades but have funded campaigns that have claimed the opposite. There is also corporate law involved that can give shareholders a cause of action for public misrepresentations. Publicly held companies have a fiduciary duty to report the honest financials of the company. If a company lies about the safety of their product, they are opening their shareholders up for an enormous amount of hidden risk that conceals the true long term viability of the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: To be clear, I'm not saying that every theory is perfect because it's possible to draw distinctions between a climate action of this scale and existing case law. But every industry wide lawsuit that has resulted in change had its own unique facts that changed the arguments a bit. I could go write up some legal arguments against why these lawsuits could fail but it's a new approach and we'll see how the courts handle it. A few ideas strike me as possible weak spots, such as the consumer's own knowledge of the harm. In other words, if the plaintiff knew of the harm (because this science was widely reported for over a hundred years), there's a question as to whether the fraud affected the behavior of the consumer, which is sometimes a required element. Also, there may be more conservative courts that impose limitation based on proximate cause simply due to the scale of the issue. I'm thinking in particular that there's a concept where a line is drawn where liability is limited even in the case of proven causation. For example, if you intentionally start a fire, and that fire extends for thousands of miles, some courts would find that you would be liable for the immediate surrounding area but not for the actual trillions of dollars of actual damage. So in this case, a court could find that an American company shouldn't be liable for sea level rise on the other side of the world because the causation is too attenuated. Either way, these lawsuits are necessary and IMO completely viable."", 'One possibility might be consumer protection laws. A company is liable for any damage their product causes when it is released into the market. For example an unlisted ingredient in some food that someone had an allergy to, or a toy for young children with little parts that are a serious choking hazard. Doubly so if they knew beforehand that there was an issue and did nothing about it, such as issue a recall. Lawyers are trying to argue that oil firms knew their product contributed to climate change, hid the data and stopped efforts to use less of their products.', 'Well put.']"

Is it like running your car in a closed garage, or is it like running it in, say, a drafty aircraft hangar?\n\nObviously answering this is the job of climate science.  But the problem is we can\'t really do any direct experiments, or gather evidence in the normal way - because we have only 1 planet, and we can\'t, for example, replicate what happened in man\'s industrialization to see if it happens again.  To use your analogy we can\'t set the car running under controlled conditions and see if CO builds up or not.\n\nSo where I\'m getting to is that the ""evidence"", in fact, consists entirely of models people have made of the climate.

I am pretty sure this must be the underlying data he has used for the comic but haven't checked.\n\nThe thing that sticks out about xkcd compared to the underlying data is how smooth it is.  That suggests he has used a moving average over quite a long period of time - and indeed he says this, without saying what period he used.  It means you even out the spikes and troughs - because even a rapid change in annual measurements, say, will not affect the moving average much.  He doesn't say what period of moving average he uses, but it seems like it must be quite a lot as the underlying data is a lot more noisy.\n\nThats fair enough but then when you look at the end of the data, you see this sharp spike upwards.  Just over 1 degree from 1880 to 2016.  That is pretty much exactly what you see in the underlying data - which seems to indicate he is no longer applying a moving average.\n\nIf that's the case, then the **xkcd is basically a fake - as it is manufacturing the appearance of a transition from smooth slow temperature changes to a sharp spike, when none exists**.  That's particularly bad as it gives the false impression that there is something very different happening now, which might of itself reasonably be taken to mean that man is the cause.\n\nedit:  found [someone's analysis of the xkcd chart](https://thefederalist.com/2016/09/30/xkcd-succumbs-to-climate-change-denial/).

An SRO is a type of housing in which residents each have only a tiny room exclusively to themselves and share all other spaces.  If you grew up in a house with a room of your own it's pretty much like that, except your room would have a bolt lock and for legal purposes be considered your apartment.  \n\nSRO's aren't new, in fact for most of the 20th century in the US they were more or less the urban norm.  SRO's fell out of favor for reasons... some good, some bad.  However it makes sense to bring them back with a new twist since these days their old failings can be rectified with modern technologies.  Materials available today allow for ample soundproofing so residents won't hear their neighbor's TV provided the door and window are shut.  Electronic keys can be matched to each unit/floor entry/and individual fridge compartment to keep resident's stuff/personal space separate.  Other fixes don't require new tech; each resident would be given a pin or hat to wear to signal to others whether he/she wants to socialize or be left alone so as to minimize unwelcome interactions while allowing those who'd welcome the chance to connect.\n\nSo basically by not forcing people to pay for space they seldom use people would get to pay far less ($300/month-$500/month) and actually get more useful space for their buck.  That's the idea.  There's resistance to them being built for reasons, all bad ones so far as I can tell.  Urban planners sometimes associate them as homeless pads because presently that's how existing SRO's are typically used, as subsidized housing for at risk populations.  Because they cater to the homeless they're associated with drug use, mental illness, crime, etc.  However there's nothing inherently unhealthy about sharing kitchen and bathroom spaces.

[Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

The higher the price of fossil fuels, the more attractive alternatives are such as renewables, nuclear, or biofuels.

The more a person pollutes, the more they pay -- yet they get the same amount back regardless of how much they've polluted. The incentive to pollute less remains because polluting is more costly."", '/u/mangoman51 :\n\n\nDecades ago, a modest carbon tax **would** have been the best solution- it could have provided a low cost, gradual path to a low carbon future that minimized the risk to our planet and humanity. We missed that boat, thanks largely to the hundreds of millions of dollars the fossil fuel industry spends annually to obstruct action on climate change. Times have changed, though- the policies that were once solutions are now palliatives. Don\'t get me wrong- carbon taxes have had some small measure of success in reducing emissions where they have been implemented. For example, in Sweden, with the world\'s strongest and longest carbon tax experience, domestic emissions have decreased around 1% a year since the turn of the millenium. Not all of this decrease can be attributed to the Sweden\'s carbon tax, of course, and since their carbon tax contains numerous exceptions and doesn\'t have a full border adjustment, Sweden\'s overall consumption based carbon footprint has actually increased through importing the carbon emissions of other countries. It\'s probably fair to say that Sweden\'s carbon tax hasn\'t significantly slowed its economic growth, and so any emissions reductions that can be attributed to it didn\'t come at a very high economic cost. Are there any better historical examples you care to cite, /u/ILikeNeurons ?  The basic economic principle is sound when applied to a marginal economic analysis. \n\nThe problem comes when we try to apply the scanty evidence for the effectiveness of carbon taxes to our present situation. We simply don\'t have much empirical, historical evidence of the effectiveness of carbon taxes in achieving more than marginal annual emissions reductions, especially any that\'s relatively analagous to the exceptional case of the US national economy. As a result, we don\'t have a firm empirically based understanding of what effect ILikeNeurons\' favored carbon tax, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR 763), would have. We must instead rely on the projections of economic models. This is problematic, because one of the key components of the HR 763 which makes it attractive to conservatives is that it binds the authority of the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions based on their global warming potential for 10 years. These next 10 years are the perhaps the most significant in the history of the human species.\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road. We can expect that carbon taxes in general and HR 763 will lead to a marginal annual reduction in CO2 emissions. However, because of decades of past inaction, the world is now in a very precarious situation with respect to CO2 emissions and the climate crisis. We are currently careening at full speed into a brick wall- CO2 emissions continue to increase at record pace and so called ""business as usual"" will likely result in us or our children witnessing catastrophic heating of 3C, 4C or even higher within our lifetimes. At the upper end of this range, global heating has been described as ""[incompatible with organized global society, devastating to the majority of ecosystems, beyond adaptation and with a high probability of not being stable.](https://grist.org/climate-change/2011-12-05-the-brutal-logic-of-climate-change/)"" We need much more than marginal annual reductions in CO2 emissions. Can HR 763 deliver what we need? \n\nFirst, we must understand that global heating is a global problem. What one individual nation contributes in emissions reductions will not solve the problem on its own. In order to limit global heating to any minimally harmful level (there is no longer any possibility of limiting global heating to a \'safe\' level- the current level of heating already runs dire risks), we must achieve a binding global agreement that limits the emissions of CO2, that is, an agreement which rations out the limited amount of carbon left to burn. Here we arrive at a quandry. The developed world (OECD) has historically emitted the vast majority of CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the developing world is rapidly growing and contributes an increasing amount to the annual total of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere. Any equitable agreement (in effect, any agreement which the developing world can be induced to honor) must allow the developing countries a sufficient amount of carbon emissions to complete they basic development of their societies which people in the developed world already enjoy. Without this aspect of fairness, the developing world will simply act in its own interest and continue to add carbon pollution to the atmosphere without restraint, thus guaranteeing that higher levels of global heating come about, for which everyone will ultimately suffer.\n\nThus, the developed world is not free to reduce its emissions as slowly as it likes if we are to avoid the worst of global heating. In fact, the developed nations must make allowance for the amount of carbon that the developing world must burn to achieve basic development, and only a smaller fraction of the available carbon is left for the developed world. In effect, the developed world must achieve carbon neutrality much faster than the developing world and complete decarbonization ahead of schedule if it is going to be possible to arrive at a global agreement to limit global heating. \n\nWhen an analysis is done that properly allows for the developing world\'s carbon needs, then based on the scientific findings of the IPCC it is seen that the smaller remaining carbon budget available to the developed world / OECD requires very rapid CO2 reductions, essentially equivalent to a 10-15% percent annual reduction rate, leading to a required decarbonization horizon of 2035 for total decarbonization of the developed world\'s energy systems, in order to allow just a 1 in 3 chance of limiting global heating to 2C. Remember that 10 year period during which HR 763 prevents the EPA from regulating greenhouse gasses? That is precisely the time when we must achieve the vast majority of our greenhouse gas reductions. Here is Professor Kevin Anderson, a specialist in carbon budget accounting and deputy director of the UK\'s preeminent climate reseach institution, the Tyndall Center for climate change research, [explaining the situation in a 6 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDCQkrRJmA). The stakes are raised further when we consider that global heating above [2C has been recently identified running the very real risk of being the approximate threshold where internal feedbacks may take control of the Earth system trajectory out of human hands towards a much warmer equilibrium](https://bigthink.com/brandon-weber/why-the-tipping-point-where-the-planet-becomes-a-hothouse-earth-is-terrifyingly-real).\n\n(Continued Below)', '(Continued)\n\nWe know that a carbon tax in general, and HR 763 in particular, can be expected to reduce CO2 emissions somewhat- but can it deliver the needed reductions outlined above to save the possibility of an off chance of limiting global heating to 2C? The answer is clearly no, and it was never designed to do so. Annual reductions of 10-15% percent in CO2 emissions are not marginal adjustments- they are probably much larger than is possible while maintaining economic growth. However, a clear view of the scientific understanding of our situation demands these reductions in order to limit global heating. We are faced with the reality that we as a species now require deep changes to our systems of social organization. We are faced with the fact that reductions in energy demand are necessary to address our predicament. This is an unpleasant reality for many people in the established economic and political order, [especially those in the global top 10% who are responsible for over 50% of consumption based emissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/comments/b3gf7e/people_in_the_top_10_of_incomes_globally_are/). In the US, for example, the top 10% of richest individuals have a larger consumption based footprint than half of the American population- 150 million people! Clearly, we could address US emissions very effectively by rationing carbon consumption of the top 10% to the level of the bottom 50% of Americans. Globally, [if the top 10% were rationed to the carbon consumption of the average European, it would be a 1/3rd cut in these global emissions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZFvc-ZOa8&t=36s). As an example of regulation, this simple act would have an immediate, direct, and tangible effect at cutting carbon emissions equal to many years of reductions under HR 763. Like this, there are vast emissions reductions available through direct regulation of CO2 as a global heating pollutant. We are in the midst of a planetary emergency- the situation demands a crisis level response, and we should be willing to countenance the necessity of profound changes to our social organization.\n\nPartly in response to the pressure of this wealthy contingent of high emitting individuals, governments, and corporations, the IPCC Working Group III has been been motivated to present the options for mitigation of carbon emissions in more palatable terms. To this end, they have devised a large number of scenarios that allow us to continue emitting beyond our carbon budget and still limit warming to acceptable levels under the assumption that future generations will draw down vast amounts of carbon from the atmosphere - literally hundreds of billions of tons- through various forms of speculative ""negative emissions technologies."" It is essentially an accounting trick that allows us to ""eat our cake and have it too"" or ""pull a rabbit out of the hat."" These scenarios have a deceptively large carbon budget for 1.5 or 2C of global heating because they transfer the burden of inventing, deploying and constructing a huge new technological system for capturing carbon onto the backs of the next generations. This is dishonest in the extreme, and it is not even guaranteed that it will ever be technically and economically feasible. Furthermore, carbon budgets for a given degree of heating are often presented as the budget for the central estimate, eg, a 50% chance of this heating. However, the scientific uncertainty around the climate system means that the same carbon budget for a 50% chance of 2C is actually yields a 10% chance of global heating of 3C or more! This uncertainty is not our friend- the difference between 2C and 3C could be the difference between a stabilized Earth and an uncontrollable transition to a catastrophically hotter climate state. Partly for these reasons, much of the role of Working Group III, who have a background mainly in economics and political science, has attracted criticism among physical science academics who see WG III\'s prescriptions, based as they are in speculative and subjective political and economic value judgements, as innappropriate for inclusion in the IPCC. There is a sense that they have been motivated to ""put the policy before the science"" to be able to tell a comfortable tale of marginal reductions that political leaders are willing to hear. \n \nSo, in summary, we are faced with a very serious problem- our current course leads to certain disaster in the lives of us and our children, and the threshold for irreversible transition to a hothouse climate state may be only 1C away. The situation calls for extreme precaution: we would not board or put our children on an airplane with a 1 in 20 or even a 1 in 100 chance of crashing, but we may in fact be running a similar risk with the entire Earth and all of the children, all of the life that is on it. The situation demands humility, respect, and contemplation, and in the final analysis, it demands carefully determined, decisive action to minimize the existential risk to our species and all of Earths varied ecosystems. In this context, an uncertain approach like a marginally effective carbon tax HR 763 coupled with the binding of the EPA\'s power to regulate CO2 as a climate pollutant is an unacceptably risky gamble with our future and the future of our children and life on Earth. Instead, we must be willing to accept and vociferously advocate the immediate, rapid and deep reductions in carbon emissions that would see us reach full decarbonization of our energy system by 2035 at the latest which can only be guaranteed by direct regulation of carbon consumption and production.\n\nTo quote Mark Twain, I apologize for writing you a long letter, I did not have time to write a short one.

This was posted, rapidly upvoted, and then taken down recently, presumably for lack of context on how this qualifies as climate action. I'll recap that briefly.

Octopuses are solitary carnivores. In order to feed and farm them at scale, massive amounts of fishmeal and fish oil will need to be harvested either from already overfished wild stocks or from environmentally denuding aquaculture. Imagine the inputs necessary to ""farm"" foxes or the domestic cat for an approximate terrestrial comparison.

The petition is addressed to the Spanish minister for agriculture and fisheries and a Canadian equivalent, but the push can be replicated in any jurisdiction.  Adapt this as a letter or a petition to a sub-national jurisdiction. If even one government preemptively bans octopus farming it will create a precedent to build momentum.

Though, I should note that we are not at all doomed. There are still many opportunities for humanity to escape the worst of the climate crisis. The doom is that you think is that we will squander all those opportunities, as we have done in the past. Well, you may be right. But consider this: climate change is ultimately nothing but a question of resource allocation. And that's why it's so highly political, since politics is the variety of mechanisms that we use to make decisions and allocate resources. If we want to combat climate change, we have to take away resources from one group of people, and give them to another or develop alternative resources and adopt their use instead. \n\nIn that way, the climate crisis reminds me very much of the global financial crisis of 2007. In that example, we allowed special interests to make our decisions for us and claim inordinate amounts of wealth for themselves through an inherently unsustainable system. When that broke down, the impact was so large governments over the world had no choice but to step in and repair the system using public goods. Essentially, these private interests were sucking the money out of the system and relied on the tax payers to repair the fallout of their recklessness, they personally profited but the global economy as a whole was damaged.\n\nThe exact same thing is happening with the global climate crisis. Private interests are making a lot of money right now because they are not paying the true costs of their actions and they are lobbying politics and influencing public discourse to keep the status quo. Once these true costs become apparent (as they slowly are now) governments will be compelled to step in and attribute significant resources into repairing the issue. You could very well imagine governments taking out hundreds of billions in new loans (and implementing new taxes) expressly for combating climate change and devoting a significant portion of GDP towards it. Suddenly we can plant billions of trees, we can invest in alternative energy, research into new technologies will get a huge boost, there will be a carbon tax, the UN quickly makes a deal on geoengineering, polluting technologies will get shut down faster with the government (partly) compensating the sector. Of course, by that time it's going to be about 10 times as expensive to fix than if we did it right now, and 100 times more expensive than if we did it 20 years ago. It will fix the issue though, or at least manage it.\n\nSo no, I don't think we are doomed. We are doomed if we stay in the current way of thinking and acting, but I think once the crisis becomes large enough we will collectively start to deal with it, difficult though it may be, and attribute significant public resources to it. Just as with the global financial crisis of 2007.\n\nIrony is of course, the public could avoid those future huge costs by voting in politicians who are willing to make the smaller investment now. But the public right now isn't willing to accept a carbon tax that would raise the prices of consumer goods, or accept that less money will go to education, health care and social security in favor of green energy development. In the end, as much as our corporate overlords are a huge part of the problem, we as the public are enabling them by looking the other way. We enjoy our cheap meat and our cheap flights, just as we enjoyed getting cheap and easy mortgages before 2007. The public is very much complicit.\n\nBut that I suppose, goes back to your original point. That it's this behaviour that leads us to our doom. Fair enough I suppose, but I guess what I'm saying: that won't hold. And while we'll have to pay the bigger bill, ultimately we will pay it and survive."", ""No time for trees.

The author said it\'s like a 1 in 20 chance that the plane you\'re about to board will crash. We would never get on that plane, yet we are willing to put our children and our grandchildren on it."" \n\n We must act now with all possible speed to reduce CO2 emissions to net zero and halt the ecological breakdown being wreaked by the economic system. \n\nWe have no time to wait.

Effectively organizing the left means we need a meta-platform for groups of all sizes, designed for content creators to funnel frustrated people into real local activism work.

Burnout is the deterioration of psychological, emotional, and physical well-being coupled with feelings of hopelessness.[1]\xa0Burnout is a severe condition that often leads activists to temporarily or even permanently withdraw from activism.[2]\xa0Unfortunately, burnout is quite common—one study found that 10-50% of union and peace activists have experienced burnout, and up to 87% of peace activists had quit activism within 6 years of getting involved.[3]\xa0Unfortunately, burnout is even more prevalent among marginalized activists, such as people of color, as they must cope not only with the stresses of activism but also with everyday acts of racism and oppression.[4]\n\xa0\nBurnout is frequently caused by the culture of martyrdom often present in activist circles[5]—activists have a heightened sense of responsibility for the issues plaguing the world,[6]\xa0feel overwhelmed at the severity of these issues,[7]\xa0and then over-work themselves in attempt to help as much as they can.[8]\xa0The culture of martyrdom also affects activists when organizations place too much pressure and make too many demands of individuals,[9]\xa0attack fellow activists in bouts of infighting,[10]\xa0and withhold critical social support.[11]""\n\nBasically, the lack of homogeny makes solidarity harder to achieve; and morale is a crucial factor to maintain motion.

The highest scoring feedback by the greatest number of users will filter to the top, and then the OP is able to edit their post, incorporate feedback, and then mark those feedback points as ‘resolved.’ People who’s contribution ends up getting resolved into the main post will get more ‘karma’ or whatever this site has.\n\nObviously a post’s full history should be viewable\nIf users who aren’t the OP want to incorporate feedback into the main post themselves, they can create their own version of the main post.

A verified email/phone is level 2.

I'm planning to scrape events from places like DSA and the Sunrise Movement and batch import everything, while also reaching out to the event leaders to coordinate. Leaders who organize events regularly will, after an interview with someone already involved in Humanitaria,  get the Community Leader rank and everything that comes with it. Community Leaders have the ability to promote people's accounts to level 3 (activist) after they join a few protests or come to other events. That'll unlock the permissions to see less above-board events like eco activism and mutual aid networks. The idea is that you should only be able to see really serious anti-cop/anti-capital events if you've been invited by someone we trust. During the interview I think it'll be important to weed out people who are accelerationist or who think violence is a good solution. Not only will those people ruin the movement, they're also more likely to be feds\n\n* Only leaders will be able to see antifa action/requests and stuff like that.

If compliance is not reasonably practicable, EPA has the option to exercise enforcement discretion if all of the following criteria are met among others:\n\n> * Act responsibly to minimize effects and duration of noncompliance caused by COVID-19\n\n> * Identify and document how COVID-19 was the cause of the noncompliance, decisions and actions taken in response, including efforts and steps taken to come into compliance as soon as possible.\n\n> * Actually return to compliance as soon as possible.\n\n> If a facility experiences a failure of air emission control or water treatment equipment, they must still notify EPA immediately. This is no different than what is currently required. The EPA will evaluate each noncompliance event on a case by case basis. Nothing in this announcement relieves any entity from their responsibility to prevent, respond to, or report accidental releases. Additionally, this policy of enforcement discretion is being adopted by states as well.\n\n> Just to further illustrate how this would play out, consider two hypothetical scenarios:\n\n> * A facility is required to take monthly water samples, analyze them for specific contaminants, and submit a report each month pursuant to their NPDES permit. Although the facility is still operating, and they are able to collect the samples each month, the lab where they normally send the samples is shut down due to COVID-19. Because it took considerable time and effort to find a lab that has the capability to analyze samples for the specific contaminants requested, they did not receive the results in time to comply with their monthly reporting requirements. Are they out of compliance? Yes. Was this foreseeable? Possibly. Were they able to come into compliance in a reasonable time frame? This is what the EPA will evaluate when considering what enforcement action, if any, to take.\n\n> * A facility generates and stores hazardous waste.

A regulated entity has been mandated to produce a product outside its scope and a major incident occurs. The incident  occurs because the entity did not have relevant compliance or trained personnel available for the production, due to COVID-19 isolation or similar. The EPA would not pursue enforcement. \n\nHowever, if a regulated entity has been mandated to produce a product outside its scope and a major incident occurs because the entity used the COVID-19 threat to reduce its compliance department to reduce costs, that would be a problem for the entity.\n\nThe greater the incident the more it will be scrutinised.
